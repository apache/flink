/**
 * An implementation of the connected components algorithm, using a delta iteration.
 *
 * Initially, the algorithm assigns each vertex an unique ID. In each step, a vertex picks the
 * minimum of its own ID and its neighbors' IDs, as its new ID and tells its neighbors about its
 * new ID. After the algorithm has completed, all vertices in the same component will have the same
 * ID.
 *
 * A vertex whose component ID did not change needs not propagate its information in the next
 * step. Because of that, the algorithm is easily expressible via a delta iteration. We here model
 * the solution set as the vertices with their current component ids, and the workset as the changed
 * vertices. Because we see all vertices initially as changed, the initial workset and the initial
 * solution set are identical. Also, the delta to the solution set is consequently also the next
 * workset.
 * 
 * Input files are plain text files and must be formatted as follows:
 *
 *   - Vertices represented as IDs and separated by new-line characters. For example,
 *     `"1\n2\n12\n42\n63\n"` gives five vertices (1), (2), (12), (42), and (63).
 *   - Edges are represented as pairs for vertex IDs which are separated by space characters. Edges
 *     are separated by new-line characters. For example `"1 2\n2 12\n1 12\n42 63\n"`
 *     gives four (undirected) edges (1)-(2), (2)-(12), (1)-(12), and (42)-(63).
 *
 * Usage:
 * {{{
 *   ConnectedComponents <vertices path> <edges path> <result path> <max number of iterations>
 * }}}
 *   
 * If no parameters are provided, the program is run with default data from
 * [[org.apache.flink.examples.java.graph.util.ConnectedComponentsData]] and 10 iterations.
 * 
 *
 * This example shows how to use:
 *
 *   - Delta Iterations
 *   - Generic-typed Functions 
 *
