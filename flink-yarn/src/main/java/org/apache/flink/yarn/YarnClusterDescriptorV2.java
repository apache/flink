 * Implementation of {@link org.apache.flink.yarn.AbstractYarnClusterDescriptor} which is used to start the new application master for a job under flip-6.
 * This implementation is now however tricky, since YarnClusterDescriptorV2 is related YarnClusterClientV2, but AbstractYarnClusterDescriptor is related
 * to YarnClusterClient. We should let YarnClusterDescriptorV2 implements ClusterDescriptor&lt;YarnClusterClientV2&gt;.
 * However, in order to use the code in AbstractYarnClusterDescriptor for setting environments and so on, we make YarnClusterDescriptorV2 as now.
