# This end-to-end test verifies that manually taking a savepoint of a running
# job and resuming from it works properly. It allows resuming the job with
# a different parallelism than the original execution.
#
# Using the general purpose DataStream job, the test covers savepointing and
# resuming when using different state backends (file, RocksDB), as well as the
# following types of states:
#  - Operator re-partitionable list state
#  - Broadcast state
#  - Union state
#  - Keyed state (ValueState)
#
# The general purpose DataStream job is self-verifiable, such that if any
# unexpected error occurs during savepoints or restores, exceptions will be
# thrown; if exactly-once is violated, alerts will be sent to output (and
# caught by the test script to fail the job).
