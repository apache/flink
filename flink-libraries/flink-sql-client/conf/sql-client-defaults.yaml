#==============================================================================
# Table Sources
#==============================================================================

# Define table sources and sinks here.

tables: [] # empty list
# A typical table source definition looks like:
# - name: ...
#   type: source
#   connector: ...
#   format: ...
#   schema: ...

#==============================================================================
# User-defined functions
#==============================================================================

# Define scalar, aggregate, or table functions here.

functions: [] # empty list
# A typical function definition looks like:
# - name: ...
#   from: class
#   class: ...
#   constructor: ...

#==============================================================================
# Execution properties
#==============================================================================

# Execution properties allow for changing the behavior of a table program.

execution:
  # 'batch' or 'streaming' execution
  type: streaming
  # allow 'event-time' or only 'processing-time' in sources
  time-characteristic: event-time
  # interval in ms for emitting periodic watermarks
  periodic-watermarks-interval: 200
  # 'changelog' or 'table' presentation of results
  result-mode: changelog
  # parallelism of the program
  parallelism: 1
  # maximum parallelism
  max-parallelism: 128
  # minimum idle state retention in ms
  min-idle-state-retention: 0
  # maximum idle state retention in ms
  max-idle-state-retention: 0
  # controls how table programs are restarted in case of a failures
  restart-strategy:
    # strategy type
    # possible values are "fixed-delay", "failure-rate", "none", or "fallback" (default)
    type: fallback


#==============================================================================
# Deployment properties
#==============================================================================

# Deployment properties allow for describing the cluster to which table
# programs are submitted to.

deployment:
  # general cluster communication timeout in ms
  response-timeout: 5000
  # (optional) address from cluster to gateway
  gateway-address: ""
  # (optional) port from cluster to gateway
  gateway-port: 0
