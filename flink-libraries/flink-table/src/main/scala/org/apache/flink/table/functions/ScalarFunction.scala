/**
  * Base class for a user-defined scalar function. A user-defined scalar functions maps zero, one,
  * or multiple scalar values to a new scalar value.
  *
  * The behavior of a [[ScalarFunction]] can be defined by implementing a custom evaluation
  * method. An evaluation method must be declared publicly and named "eval". Evaluation methods
  * can also be overloaded by implementing multiple methods named "eval".
  *
  * User-defined functions must have a default constructor and must be instantiable during runtime.
  *
  * By default the result type of an evaluation method is determined by Flink's type extraction
  * facilities. This is sufficient for basic types or simple POJOs but might be wrong for more
  * complex, custom, or composite types. In these cases [[TypeInformation]] of the result type
  * can be manually defined by overriding [[getResultType()]].
  *
  * Internally, the Table/SQL API code generation works with primitive values as much as possible.
  * If a user-defined scalar function should not introduce much overhead during runtime, it is
  * recommended to declare parameters and result types as primitive types instead of their boxed
  * classes. DATE/TIME is equal to int, TIMESTAMP is equal to long.
