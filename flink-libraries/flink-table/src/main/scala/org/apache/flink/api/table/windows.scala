  * Group-windows group rows based on time or row-count intervals and is therefore essentially a
  * special type of groupBy. Just like groupBy, group-windows allow to compute aggregates
  * on groups of elements.
  *
  * Infinite streaming tables can only be grouped into time or row intervals. Hence window grouping
  * is required to apply aggregations on streaming tables.
  *
  * For finite batch tables, group-windows provide shortcuts for time-based groupBy.
