/**
  * Defines an external [[TableSink]] to emit a streaming [[Table]] with insert, update, and delete
  * changes. The [[Table]] must be have unique key fields (atomic or composite) or be append-only.
  *
  * If the [[Table]] does not have a unique key and is not append-only, a
  * [[org.apache.flink.table.api.TableException]] will be thrown.
  *
  * The unique key of the table is configured by the [[UpsertStreamTableSink#setKeyFields()]]
  * method.
  *
  * The [[Table]] will be converted into a stream of upsert and delete messages which are encoded as
  * [[JTuple2]]. The first field is a [[JBool]] flag to indicate the message type. The second field
  * holds the record of the requested type [[T]].
  *
  * A message with true [[JBool]] field is an upsert message for the configured key.
  * A message with false flag is a delete message for the configured key.
  *
  * If the table is append-only, all messages will have a true flag and must be interpreted
  * as insertions.
  *
  * @tparam T Type of records that this [[TableSink]] expects and supports.
