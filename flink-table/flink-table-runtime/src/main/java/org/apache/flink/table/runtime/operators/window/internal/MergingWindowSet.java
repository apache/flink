/**
 * Utility for keeping track of merging {@link Window Windows} when using a {@link
 * MergingWindowAssigner} in a {@code WindowOperator}.
 *
 * <p>When merging windows, we keep one of the original windows as the state window, i.e. the window
 * that is used as namespace to store the window elements. Elements from the state windows of merged
 * windows must be merged into this one state window. We keep a mapping from in-flight window to
 * state window that can be queried using {@link #getStateWindow(Window)}.
 *
 * <p>A new window can be added to the set of in-flight windows using {@link #addWindow(Window,
 * MergeFunction)}. This might merge other windows and the caller must react accordingly in the
 * {@link MergeFunction#merge(Object, Collection, Object, Collection)} and adjust the outside view
 * of windows and state.
 *
 * <p>Windows can be removed from the set of windows using {@link #retireWindow(Window)}.
 *
 * @param <W> The type of {@code Window} that this set is keeping track of.
