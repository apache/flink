/**
  * Batch physical RelNode for aggregate.
  *
  * <P>There are two differences between this node and [[Aggregate]]:
  * 1. This node supports two-stage aggregation to reduce data-shuffling:
  * local-aggregation and global-aggregation.
  * local-aggregation produces a partial result for each group before shuffle in stage 1,
  * and then the partially aggregated results are shuffled to global-aggregation
  * which produces the final result in stage 2.
  * Two-stage aggregation is enabled only if all aggregate functions are mergeable.
  * (e.g. SUM, AVG, MAX)
  * 2. This node supports auxiliary group keys which will not be computed as key and
  * does not also affect the correctness of the final result. [[Aggregate]] does not distinguish
  * group keys and auxiliary group keys, and combines them as a complete `groupSet`.
