/**
  * This RelNode represents a change of partitioning of the input elements.
  *
  * This does not create a physical transformation If its relDistribution' type is not range,
  * it only affects how upstream operations are connected to downstream operations.
  *
  * But if the type is range, this relNode will create some physical transformation because it
  * need calculate the data distribution. To calculate the data distribution, the received stream
  * will split in two process stream. For the first process stream, it will go through the sample
  * and statistics to calculate the data distribution in pipeline mode. For the second process
  * stream will been bocked. After the first process stream has been calculated successfully,
  * then the two process stream  will union together. Thus it can partitioner the record based
  * the data distribution. Then The RelNode will create the following transformations.
