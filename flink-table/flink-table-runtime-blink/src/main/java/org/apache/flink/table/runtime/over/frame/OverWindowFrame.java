/**
 * A window frame calculates the results for those records belong to a window frame. Before use a frame
 * must be prepared by passing it all the records in the current partition. A frame is a subset of the
 * current partition and the frame clause specifies how to define the subset. Frames are determined with
 * respect to the current row, which enables a frame to move within a partition depending on the location
 * of the current row within its partition. More information:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-8.0-en/window-functions-frames.html
 *
 * <p>E.g.:
 * SELECT d, e, f,
 *  sum(e) over (partition by d order by e rows between 5 PRECEDING and 2 FOLLOWING),              -- frame 1
 *  count(*) over (partition by d order by e desc rows between 6 PRECEDING and 2 FOLLOWING),       -- frame 2
 *  max(f) over (partition by d order by e rows between UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and CURRENT ROW),      -- frame 3
 *  min(h) over (partition by d order by e desc rows between CURRENT ROW and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING), -- frame 4
 *  h FROM Table5
 * The above sql has 4 frames.
 *
 * <p>Over AGG means that every Row has a corresponding output.
 * OverWindowFrame is called by:
 * 1.Get all data and invoke {@link #prepare(ResettableExternalBuffer)} for partition
 * 2.Then each Row is traversed one by one to invoke {@link #process(int, BaseRow)} to get the calculation
 * results of the currentRow.
