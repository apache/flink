The following options are available:

Mode "embedded" (default) submits Flink jobs from the local machine.

  Syntax: [embedded] [OPTIONS]
  "embedded" mode options:
     -D <session dynamic config key=val>        The dynamic config key=val for a
                                                session.
     -f,--file <script file>                    Script file that should be
                                                executed. In this mode, the
                                                client will not open an
                                                interactive terminal.
     -h,--help                                  Show the help message with
                                                descriptions of all options.
     -hist,--history <History file path>        The file which you want to save
                                                the command history into. If not
                                                specified, we will auto-generate
                                                one under your user's home
                                                directory.
     -i,--init <initialization file>            Script file that used to init
                                                the session context. If get
                                                error in execution, the sql
                                                client will exit. Notice it's
                                                not allowed to add query or
                                                insert into the init file.

                                                the session. The file might
                                                contain user-defined classes
                                                needed for the execution of
                                                statements such as functions,
                                                table sources, or sinks. Can be
                                                used multiple times.
     -l,--library <JAR directory>               A JAR file directory with which
                                                every new session is
                                                initialized. The files might
                                                contain user-defined classes
                                                needed for the execution of
                                                statements such as functions,
                                                table sources, or sinks. Can be
                                                used multiple times.
     -pyarch,--pyArchives <arg>                 Add python archive files for
                                                job. The archive files will be
                                                extracted to the working
                                                directory of python UDF worker.
                                                For each archive file, a target
                                                directory be specified. If the
                                                target directory name is
                                                specified, the archive file will
                                                be extracted to a directory with
                                                the specified name. Otherwise,
                                                the archive file will be
                                                extracted to a directory with
                                                the same name of the archive
                                                file. The files uploaded via
                                                this option are accessible via
                                                relative path. '#' could be used
                                                as the separator of the archive
                                                file path and the target
                                                directory name. Comma (',')
                                                could be used as the separator
                                                to specify multiple archive
                                                files. This option can be used
                                                to upload the virtual
                                                environment, the data files used
                                                in Python UDF (e.g.,
                                                --pyArchives
                                                file:///tmp/py37.zip,file:///tmp

                                                py37.zip/py37/bin/python). The
                                                data files could be accessed in
                                                Python UDF, e.g.: f =
                                                open('data/data.txt', 'r').

                                                the Python jobs via "flink run"
                                                or compiling the Java/Scala jobs
                                                containing Python UDFs.
     -pyexec,--pyExecutable <arg>               Specify the path of the python
                                                interpreter used to execute the
                                                python UDF worker (e.g.:
                                                --pyExecutable
                                                /usr/local/bin/python3). The

                                                Python 3.8+, Apache Beam
                                                (version == 2.43.0), Pip
                                                (version >= 20.3) and SetupTools

                                                requirements.
     -pyfs,--pyFiles <pythonFiles>              Attach custom files for job. The

                                                such as .py/.egg/.zip/.whl or
                                                directory are all supported.
                                                These files will be added to the

                                                client and the remote python UDF
                                                worker. Files suffixed with .zip
                                                will be extracted and added to
                                                PYTHONPATH. Comma (',') could be
                                                used as the separator to specify
                                                multiple files (e.g., --pyFiles

                                                dependencies. These dependencies
                                                will be installed and added to
                                                the PYTHONPATH of the python UDF
