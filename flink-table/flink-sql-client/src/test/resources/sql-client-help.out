  Syntax: [embedded] [OPTIONS]
  "embedded" mode options:
     -d,--defaults <environment file>      The environment properties with which
                                           every new session is initialized.
                                           Properties might be overwritten by
                                           session properties.
     -e,--environment <environment file>   The environment properties to be
                                           imported into the session. It might
                                           overwrite default environment
                                           properties.
     -h,--help                             Show the help message with
                                           descriptions of all options.
     -hist,--history <History file path>   The file which you want to save the
                                           command history into. If not
                                           specified, we will auto-generate one
                                           under your user's home directory.
     -j,--jar <JAR file>                   A JAR file to be imported into the
                                           session. The file might contain
                                           user-defined classes needed for the
                                           execution of statements such as
                                           functions, table sources, or sinks.
                                           Can be used multiple times.
     -l,--library <JAR directory>          A JAR file directory with which every
                                           new session is initialized. The files
                                           might contain user-defined classes
                                           needed for the execution of
                                           statements such as functions, table
                                           sources, or sinks. Can be used
                                           multiple times.
     -pyarch,--pyArchives <arg>            Add python archive files for job. The
                                           archive files will be extracted to
                                           the working directory of python UDF
                                           worker. Currently only zip-format is
                                           supported. For each archive file, a
                                           target directory be specified. If the
                                           target directory name is specified,
                                           the archive file will be extracted to
                                           a name can directory with the
                                           specified name. Otherwise, the
                                           archive file will be extracted to a
                                           directory with the same name of the
                                           archive file. The files uploaded via
                                           this option are accessible via
                                           relative path. '#' could be used as
                                           the separator of the archive file
                                           path and the target directory name.
                                           Comma (',') could be used as the
                                           separator to specify multiple archive
                                           files. This option can be used to
                                           upload the virtual environment, the
                                           data files used in Python UDF (e.g.:
                                           --pyArchives
                                           file:///tmp/py37.zip,file:///tmp/data
                                           .zip#data --pyExecutable
                                           py37.zip/py37/bin/python). The data
                                           files could be accessed in Python
                                           UDF, e.g.: f = open('data/data.txt',
                                           'r').
     -pyexec,--pyExecutable <arg>          Specify the path of the python
                                           interpreter used to execute the
                                           python UDF worker (e.g.:
                                           --pyExecutable
                                           /usr/local/bin/python3). The python
                                           UDF worker depends on Python 3.6+,
                                           Apache Beam (version == 2.27.0), Pip
                                           (version >= 7.1.0) and SetupTools
                                           (version >= 37.0.0). Please ensure
                                           that the specified environment meets
                                           the above requirements.
     -pyfs,--pyFiles <pythonFiles>         Attach custom python files for job.
                                           The standard python resource file
                                           suffixes such as .py/.egg/.zip or
                                           directory are all supported. These
                                           files will be added to the PYTHONPATH
                                           of both the local client and the
                                           remote python UDF worker. Files
                                           suffixed with .zip will be extracted
                                           and added to PYTHONPATH. Comma (',')
                                           could be used as the separator to
                                           specify multiple files (e.g.:
                                           --pyFiles
                                           file:///tmp/myresource.zip,hdfs:///$n
                                           amenode_address/myresource2.zip).
     -pyreq,--pyRequirements <arg>         Specify a requirements.txt file which
                                           defines the third-party dependencies.
                                           These dependencies will be installed
                                           and added to the PYTHONPATH of the
                                           python UDF worker. A directory which
                                           contains the installation packages of
                                           these dependencies could be specified
                                           optionally. Use '#' as the separator
                                           if the optional parameter exists
                                           (e.g.: --pyRequirements
                                           file:///tmp/requirements.txt#file:///
                                           tmp/cached_dir).
     -s,--session <session identifier>     The identifier for a session.
                                           'default' is the default identifier.
     -u,--update <SQL update statement>    Experimental (for testing only!):
                                           Instructs the SQL Client to
                                           immediately execute the given update
                                           statement after starting up. The
                                           process is shut down after the
                                           statement has been submitted to the
                                           cluster and returns an appropriate
                                           return code. Currently, this feature
                                           is only supported for INSERT INTO
                                           statements that declare the target
                                           sink table.
