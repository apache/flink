/**
 * Factory that creates {@link Executor}.

 * called with a set of normalized properties that describe the desired configuration. Those properties
 * may include execution configurations such as watermark interval, max parallelism etc., table specific
 * initialization configuration such as if the queries should be executed in batch mode.
 *
 * <p><b>Important:</b> The implementations of this interface should also implement method

 * {@code public Executor create(Map<String, String> properties, StreamExecutionEnvironment executionEnvironment);}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This method will be used when instantiating a {@link org.apache.flink.table.api.TableEnvironment}
 * from a bridging module which enables conversion from/to {@code DataStream} API and requires a pre
 * configured {@code StreamTableEnvironment}.
