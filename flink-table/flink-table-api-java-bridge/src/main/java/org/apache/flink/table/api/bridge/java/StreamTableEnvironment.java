    /**
     * Creates a view from the given {@link DataStream} in a given path with specified field names.
     * Registered views can be referenced in SQL queries.
     *
     * <p>There are two modes for mapping original fields to the fields of the View:
     *
     * <p>1. Reference input fields by name: All fields in the schema definition are referenced by
     * name (and possibly renamed using an alias (as). Moreover, we can define proctime and rowtime
     * attributes at arbitrary positions using arbitrary names (except those that exist in the
     * result schema). In this mode, fields can be reordered and projected out. This mode can be
     * used for any input type, including POJOs.
     *
     * <p>Example:
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     * DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> stream = ...
     * tableEnv.createTemporaryView(
     *    "cat.db.myTable",
     *    stream,
     *    $("f1"), // reorder and use the original field
     *    $("rowtime").rowtime(), // extract the internally attached timestamp into an event-time
     *                            // attribute named 'rowtime'
     *    $("f0").as("name") // reorder and give the original field a better name
     * );
     * }</pre>
     *
     * <p>2. Reference input fields by position: In this mode, fields are simply renamed. Event-time
     * attributes can replace the field on their position in the input data (if it is of correct
     * type) or be appended at the end. Proctime attributes must be appended at the end. This mode
     * can only be used if the input type has a defined field order (tuple, case class, Row) and
     * none of the {@code fields} references a field of the input type.
     *
     * <p>Example:
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     * DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> stream = ...
     * tableEnv.createTemporaryView(
     *    "cat.db.myTable",
     *    stream,
     *    $("a"), // rename the first field to 'a'
     *    $("b"), // rename the second field to 'b'
     *    $("rowtime").rowtime() // adds an event-time attribute named 'rowtime'
     * );
     * }</pre>
