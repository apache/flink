/**
 * Enables to push down watermarks into a {@link ScanTableSource}.
 *
 * <p>The concept of watermarks defines when time operations based on an event time attribute will be
 * triggered. A watermark tells operators that no elements with a timestamp older or equal to the watermark
 * timestamp should arrive at the operator. Thus, watermarks are a trade-off between latency and completeness.
 *
 * <p>Given the following SQL:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   CREATE TABLE t (i INT, ts TIMESTAMP(3), WATERMARK FOR ts AS ts - INTERVAL '5' SECOND)  // `ts` becomes a time attribute
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In the above example, generated watermarks are lagging 5 seconds behind the highest seen timestamp.
 *
 * <p>For correctness, it might be necessary to perform the watermark generation as early as
 * possible in order to be close to the actual data generation within a source's data partition.
 *
 * <p>If the {@link ScanTableSource#getScanRuntimeProvider(ScanTableSource.ScanContext)} returns
 * {@link SourceProvider}, watermarks will be automatically pushed into the runtime source operator
 * by the framework. In this case, this interface does not need to be implemented.
 *
 * <p>If the {@link ScanTableSource} does not return a {@link SourceProvider} and this interface is
 * not implemented, watermarks are generated in a subsequent operation after the source. In this case,
 * it is recommended to implement this interface to perform the watermark generation within source's
 * data partition.
 *
 * <p>This interface provides a {@link WatermarkStrategy} that needs to be applied to the runtime
 * implementation. Most built-in Flink sources provide a way of setting the watermark generator.
