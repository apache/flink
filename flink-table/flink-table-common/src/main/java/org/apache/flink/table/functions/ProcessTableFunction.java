/**
 * Base class for a user-defined process table function. A process table function (PTF) maps zero,
 * one, or multiple tables to zero, one, or multiple rows (or structured types). Scalar arguments
 * are also supported. If the output record consists of only one field, the wrapper can be omitted,
 * and a scalar value can be emitted that will be implicitly wrapped into a row by the runtime.
 *
 * <p>PTFs are the most powerful function kind for Flink SQL and Table API. They enable implementing
 * user-defined operators that can be as feature-rich as built-in operations. PTFs have access to
 * Flink's managed state, event-time and timer services, underlying table changelogs, and can take
 * multiple ordered and/or partitioned tables to produce a new table.
 *
 * <h1>Table Semantics and Virtual Processors</h1>
 *
 * <p>PTFs can produce a new table by consuming tables as arguments. For scalability, input tables
 * are distributed across so-called "virtual processors". A virtual processor, as defined by the SQL
 * standard, executes a PTF instance and has access only to a portion of the entire table. The
 * argument declaration decides about the size of the portion and co-location of data. Conceptually,
 * tables can be processed either "as row" (i.e. with row semantics) or "as set" (i.e. with set
 * semantics).
 *
 * <h2>Table Argument with Row Semantics</h2>
 *
 * <p>A PTF that takes a table with row semantics assumes that there is no correlation between rows
 * and each row can be processed independently. The framework is free in how to distribute rows
 * across virtual processors and each virtual processor has access only to the currently processed
 * row.
 *
 * <h2>Table Argument with Set Semantics</h2>
 *
 * <p>A PTF that takes a table with set semantics assumes that there is a correlation between rows.
 * When calling the function, the PARTITION BY clause defines the columns for correlation. The
 * framework ensures that all rows belonging to same set are co-located. A PTF instance is able to
 * access all rows belonging to the same set. In other words: The virtual processor is scoped by a
 * key context.
 *
 * <p>It is also possible not to provide a key ({@link ArgumentTrait#OPTIONAL_PARTITION_BY}), in
 * which case only one virtual processor handles the entire table, thereby losing scalability
 * benefits.
 *
 * <h1>Implementation</h1>
 *
 * <p>The behavior of a {@link ProcessTableFunction} can be defined by implementing a custom
 * evaluation method. The evaluation method must be declared publicly, not static, and named <code>
 * eval</code>. Overloading is not supported.
 *
 * <p>For storing a user-defined function in a catalog, the class must have a default constructor
 * and must be instantiable during runtime. Anonymous functions in Table API can only be persisted
 * if the function object is not stateful (i.e. containing only transient and static fields).
 *
 * <h2>Data Types</h2>
 *
 * <p>By default, input and output data types are automatically extracted using reflection. This
 * includes the generic argument {@code T} of the class for determining an output data type. Input
 * arguments are derived from the {@code eval()} method. If the reflective information is not
 * sufficient, it can be supported and enriched with {@link FunctionHint}, {@link ArgumentHint}, and
 * {@link DataTypeHint} annotations.
 *
 * <p>The following examples show how to specify data types:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Function that accepts two scalar INT arguments and emits them as an implicit ROW < INT >
 * class AdditionFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Integer> {
 *   public void eval(Integer a, Integer b) {
 *     collect(a + b);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Function that produces an explicit ROW < i INT, s STRING > from arguments, the function hint helps in
 * // declaring the row's fields
 * @FunctionHint(output = @DataTypeHint("ROW< i INT, s STRING >"))
 * class DuplicatorFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Row> {
 *   public void eval(Integer i, String s) {
 *     collect(Row.of(i, s));
 *     collect(Row.of(i, s));
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Function that accepts DECIMAL(10, 4) and emits it as an explicit ROW < DECIMAL(10, 4) >
 * @FunctionHint(output = @DataTypeHint("ROW< DECIMAL(10, 4) >"))
 * class DuplicatorFunction extends TableFunction<Row> {
 *   public void eval(@DataTypeHint("DECIMAL(10, 4)") BigDecimal d) {
 *     collect(Row.of(d));
 *     collect(Row.of(d));
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Arguments</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@link ArgumentHint} annotation enables declaring the name, data type, and kind of each
 * argument (i.e. ArgumentTrait.SCALAR, ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_SET, or ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_ROW).
 * It allows specifying other traits for table arguments as well:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Function that has two arguments:
 * // "input_table" (a table with set semantics) and "threshold" (a scalar value)
 * class ThresholdFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<Integer> {
 *   public void eval(
 *       // For table arguments, a data type for Row is optional (leading to polymorphic behavior)
 *       @ArgumentHint(value = ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_SET, name = "input_table") Row t,
 *       // Scalar arguments require a data type either explicit or via reflection
 *       @ArgumentHint(value = ArgumentTrait.SCALAR, name = "threshold") Integer threshold) {
 *     int amount = t.getFieldAs("amount");
 *     if (amount >= threshold) {
 *       collect(amount);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Table arguments can declare a concrete data type (of either row or structured type) or accept
 * any type of row in polymorphic fashion:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Function with explicit table argument type of row
 * class MyPTF extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public void eval(Context ctx, @ArgumentHint(value = ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_SET, type = @DataTypeHint("ROW < s STRING >")) Row t) {
 *     TableSemantics semantics = ctx.tableSemanticsFor("t");
 *     // Always returns "ROW < s STRING >"
 *     semantics.dataType();
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Function with explicit table argument type of structured type "Customer"
 * class MyPTF extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public void eval(Context ctx, @ArgumentHint(value = ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_SET) Customer c) {
 *     TableSemantics semantics = ctx.tableSemanticsFor("c");
 *     // Always returns structured type of "Customer"
 *     semantics.dataType();
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Function with polymorphic table argument
 * class MyPTF extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public void eval(Context ctx, @ArgumentHint(value = ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_SET) Row t) {
 *     TableSemantics semantics = ctx.tableSemanticsFor("t");
 *     // Always returns "ROW" but content depends on the table that is passed into the call
 *     semantics.dataType();
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Context</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@link Context} can be added as a first argument to the eval() method for additional
 * information about the input tables and other services provided by the framework:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // a function that accesses the Context for reading the PARTITION BY columns and
 * // excluding them when building a result string
 * class ConcatNonKeysFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public void eval(Context ctx, @ArgumentHint(ArgumentTrait.TABLE_AS_SET) Row inputTable) {
 *     TableSemantics semantics = ctx.tableSemanticsFor("inputTable");
 *     List<Integer> keys = Arrays.asList(semantics.partitionByColumns());
 *     return IntStream.range(0, inputTable.getArity())
 *       .filter(pos -> !keys.contains(pos))
 *       .mapToObj(inputTable::getField)
 *       .map(Object::toString)
 *       .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h1>State</h1>
 *
 * <p>A PTF that takes set semantic tables can be stateful. Intermediate results can be buffered,
 * cached, aggregated, or simply stored for repeated access. A function can have one or more state
 * entries which are managed by the framework. Flink takes care of storing and restoring those
 * during failures or restarts (i.e. Flink managed state).
 *
 * <p>A state entry is partitioned by a key and cannot be accessed globally. The partitioning (or a
 * single partition in case of no partitioning) is defined by the corresponding function call. In
 * other words: Similar to how a virtual processor has access only to a portion of the entire table,
 * a PTF has access only to a portion of the entire state defined by the PARTITION BY clause. In
 * Flink, this concept is also known as keyed state.
 *
 * <p>State entries can be added as a mutable parameter to the eval() method. In order to
 * distinguish them from call arguments, they must be declared before any other argument, but after
 * an optional {@link Context} parameter. Furthermore, they must be annotated either via {@link
 * StateHint} or declared as part of {@link FunctionHint#state()}.
 *
 * <p>For read and write access, only row or structured types (i.e. POJOs with default constructor)
 * qualify as a data type. If no state is present, all fields are set to null (in case of a row
 * type) or fields are set to their default value (in case of a structured type). For state
 * efficiency, it is recommended to keep all fields nullable.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // a function that counts and stores its intermediate result in the CountState object
 * // which will be persisted by Flink
 * class CountingFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public static class CountState {
 *     public long count = 0L;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void eval(@StateHint CountState memory, @ArgumentHint(TABLE_AS_SET) Row input) {
 *     memory.count++;
 *     collect("Seen rows: " + memory.count);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // a function that waits for a second event coming in
 * class CountingFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public static class SeenState {
 *     public String first;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void eval(@StateHint SeenState memory, @ArgumentHint(TABLE_AS_SET) Row input) {
 *     if (memory.first == null) {
 *       memory.first = input.toString();
 *     } else {
 *       collect("Event 1: " + memory.first + " and Event 2: " + input.toString());
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // a function that uses Row for state
 * class CountingFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public void eval(@StateHint(type = @DataTypeHint("ROW < count BIGINT >")) Row memory, @ArgumentHint(TABLE_AS_SET) Row input) {
 *     Long newCount = 1L;
 *     if (memory.getField("count") != null) {
 *       newCount += memory.getFieldAs("count");
 *     }
 *     memory.setField("count", newCount);
 *     collect("Seen rows: " + newCount);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Efficiency and Design Principles</h2>
 *
 * <p>A stateful function also means that data layout and data retention should be well thought
 * through. An ever-growing state can happen by an unlimited number of partitions (i.e. an open
 * keyspace) or even within a partition. Consider setting a {@link StateHint#ttl()} or call {@link
 * Context#clearAllState()} eventually:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // a function that waits for a second event coming in BUT with better state efficiency
 * class CountingFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public static class SeenState {
 *     public String first;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void eval(Context ctx, @StateHint(ttl = "1 day") SeenState memory, @ArgumentHint(TABLE_AS_SET) Row input) {
 *     if (memory.first == null) {
 *       memory.first = input.toString();
 *     } else {
 *       collect("Event 1: " + memory.first + " and Event 2: " + input.toString());
 *       ctx.clearAllState();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h1>Time and Timers</h1>
 *
 * <p>A PTF supports event time natively. Time-based services are available via {@link
 * Context#timeContext(Class)}.
 *
 * <h2>Time</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every PTF takes an optional {@code on_time} argument. The {@code on_time} argument in the
 * function call declares the time attribute column for which a watermark has been declared. When
 * processing a table's row, this timestamp can be accessed via {@link TimeContext#time()} and the
 * watermark via {@link TimeContext#currentWatermark()} respectively.
 *
 * <p>Specifying an {@code on_time} argument in the function call instructs the framework to return
 * a {@code rowtime} column in the function's output for subsequent time-based operations.
 *
 * <p>The {@link ArgumentTrait#REQUIRE_ON_TIME} makes the {@code on_time} argument mandatory if
 * necessary.
 *
 * <h2>Timers</h2>
 *
 * <p>A PTF that takes set semantic tables can support timers. Timers allow for continuing the
 * processing at a later point in time. This makes waiting, synchronization, or timeouts possible. A
 * timer fires for the registered time when the watermark progresses the logical clock.
 *
 * <p>Timers can be named ({@link TimeContext#registerOnTime(String, Object)}) or unnamed ({@link
 * TimeContext#registerOnTime(Object)}). The name of a timer can be useful for replacing or deleting
 * an existing timer, or for identifying multiple timers via {@link OnTimerContext#currentTimer()}
 * when they fire.
 *
 * <p>An {@code onTimer()} method must be declared next to the eval() method for reacting to timer
 * events. The signature of the onTimer() method must contain an optional {@link OnTimerContext}
 * followed by all state entries (as declared in the eval() method).
 *
 * <p>Flink takes care of storing and restoring timers during failures or restarts. Thus, timers are
 * a special kind of state. Similarly, timers are scoped to a virtual processor defined by the
 * PARTITION BY clause. A timer can only be registered and deleted in the current virtual processor.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // a function that waits for a second event or timeouts after 60 seconds
 * class TimerFunction extends ProcessTableFunction<String> {
 *   public static class SeenState {
 *     public String seen = null;
 *   }
 *
 *   public void eval(Context ctx, @StateHint SeenState memory, @ArgumentHint( { TABLE_AS_SET, REQUIRE_ON_TIME } ) Row input) {
 *     TimeContext<Instant> timeCtx = ctx.timeContext(Instant.class);
 *     if (memory.seen == null) {
 *       memory.seen = input.getField(0).toString();
 *       timeCtx.registerOnTimer("timeout", timeCtx.time().plusSeconds(60));
 *     } else {
 *       collect("Second event arrived for: " + memory.seen)
 *       ctx.clearAll();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void onTimer(SeenState memory) {
 *     collect("Timeout for: " + memory.seen)
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Efficiency and Design Principles</h2>
 *
 * <p>Registering too many timers might affect performance. An ever-growing timer state can happen
 * by an unlimited number of partitions (i.e. an open keyspace) or even within a partition. Thus,
 * reduce the number of registered timers to a minimum and consider cleaning up timers if they are
 * not needed anymore via {@link Context#clearAllTimers()} or {@link
 * TimeContext#clearTimer(String)}.
