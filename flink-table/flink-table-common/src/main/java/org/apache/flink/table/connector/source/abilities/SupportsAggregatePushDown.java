/**
 * Enables to push down the local aggregates into a {@link ScanTableSource}.
 *
 * <p>Given the following example inventory table:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * CREATE TABLE inventory (
 *   id INT,
 *   name STRING,
 *   amount INT,
 *   price DOUBLE,
 *   type STRING
 * )
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>And we have a simple aggregate sql:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * SELECT
 *   SUM(amount),
 *   MAX(price),
 *   AVG(price),
 *   COUNT(1),
 *   name,
 *   type
 * FROM inventory
 * GROUP BY name, type
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In the example above, {@code sum(amount), max(price), avg(price), count(1)} and {@code group
 * by name, type} are aggregate functions and grouping sets. By default, if this interface is not
 * implemented, local aggregates are applied in a subsequent operation after the source. The
 * optimized plan will be the following without local aggregate push down:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Calc(select=[EXPR$0, EXPR$1, EXPR$2, EXPR$3, name, type])
 * +- HashAggregate(groupBy=[name, type], select=[name, type, Final_SUM(sum$0) AS EXPR$0, Final_MAX(max$1) AS EXPR$1, Final_AVG(sum$2, count$3) AS EXPR$2, Final_COUNT(count1$4) AS EXPR$3])
 *    +- Exchange(distribution=[hash[name, type]])
 *       +- LocalHashAggregate(groupBy=[name, type], select=[name, type, Partial_SUM(amount) AS sum$0, Partial_MAX(price) AS max$1, Partial_AVG(price) AS (sum$2, count$3), Partial_COUNT(*) AS count1$4])
 *          +- TableSourceScan(table=[[inventory, project=[name, type, amount, price]]], fields=[name, type, amount, price])
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For efficiency, a source can push the local aggregates further down into underlying database
 * or storage system to reduce the network and computing overhead. The passed aggregate functions
 * and grouping sets are in the order defined by the query. The source can directly return the
 * aggregated values if the underlying database or storage system has aggregation capability. The
 * optimized plan will be changed to the following pattern with local aggregate push down:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Calc(select=[EXPR$0, EXPR$1, EXPR$2, EXPR$3, name, type])
 * +- HashAggregate(groupBy=[name, type], select=[name, type, Final_SUM(sum$0) AS EXPR$0, Final_MAX(max$1) AS EXPR$1, Final_AVG(sum$2, count$3) AS EXPR$2, Final_COUNT(count1$4) AS EXPR$3])
 *    +- Exchange(distribution=[hash[name, type]])
 *       +- TableSourceScan(table=[[inventory, project=[name, type, amount, price], aggregates=[grouping=[name,type], aggFunctions=[IntSumAggFunction(amount),DoubleMaxAggFunction(price),DoubleSum0AggFunction(price),CountAggFunction(price),Count1AggFunction()]]]], fields=[name, type, sum$0, max$1, sum$2, count$3, count1$4])
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>We can see the original {@code LocalHashAggregate} has been removed and pushed down into the
 * {@code TableSourceScan}. Meanwhile the output datatype of {@code TableSourceScan} has changed,
 * which is the pattern of {@code grouping sets} + {@code the output of aggregate functions}.
 *
 * <p>Due to the complexity of aggregate, the aggregate push down does not support a number of more
 * complex statements at present:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>complex grouping operations such as ROLLUP, CUBE, or GROUPING SETS.
 *   <li>expressions inside the aggregation function call: such as sum(a * b).
 *   <li>aggregations with ordering.
 *   <li>aggregations with filter.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For the above example inventory table, and we have the following test sql:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * SELECT
 *   SUM(amount) FILTER(WHERE amount > 0),
 *   name,
 *   type
 * FROM inventory
 * GROUP BY name, type
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Since there is a filter after the sum aggregate function. And the optimized plan as shown
 * below. The local aggregate will not be pushed down in this scenario.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Calc(select=[EXPR$0, name, type])
 * +- HashAggregate(isMerge=[true], groupBy=[name, type], select=[name, type, Final_SUM(sum$0) AS EXPR$0])
 *    +- Exchange(distribution=[hash[name, type]])
 *       +- LocalHashAggregate(groupBy=[name, type], select=[name, type, Partial_SUM(amount) FILTER $f3 AS sum$0])
 *          +- Calc(select=[name, type, amount, IS TRUE(>(amount, 0)) AS $f3])
 *             +- TableSourceScan(table=[[inventory, project=[name, type, amount]]], fields=[name, type, amount])
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: The local aggregate push down strategy is all or nothing, it can only be pushed down if
 * all aggregate functions are supported.
 *
 * <p>Regardless if this interface is implemented or not, a final aggregation is always applied in a
 * subsequent operation after the source.
