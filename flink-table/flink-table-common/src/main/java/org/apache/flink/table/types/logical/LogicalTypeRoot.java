/**
 * An enumeration of logical type roots containing static information about logical data types.
 *
 * <p>A root is an essential description of a {@link LogicalType} without additional parameters. For
 * example, a parameterized logical type {@code DECIMAL(12,3)} possesses all characteristics of its
 * root {@code DECIMAL}. Additionally, a logical type root enables efficient comparision during the
 * evaluation of types.
 *
 * <p>The enumeration is very close to the SQL standard in terms of naming and completeness. However,
 * it reflects just a subset of the evolving standard and contains some extensions (such as {@code NULL},
 * {@code SYMBOL}, or {@code ANY}).
 *
 * <p>See the type-implementing classes for a more detailed description of each type.
