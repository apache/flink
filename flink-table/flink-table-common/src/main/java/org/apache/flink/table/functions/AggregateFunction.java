/**
 * Base class for user-defined aggregates.
 *
 * <p>The behavior of an {@link AggregateFunction} can be defined by implementing a series of custom
 * methods. An {@link AggregateFunction} needs at least three methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>createAccumulator</li>
 *     <li>accumulate</li>
 *     <li>getValue</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There are a few other methods that can be optional to have:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>retract</li>
 *     <li>merge</li>
 *     <li>resetAccumulator</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All these methods must be declared publicly, not static, and named exactly as the names
 * mentioned above. The method {@link #createAccumulator()} is defined in the
 * {@link ImperativeAggregateFunction} function, and method {@link #getValue} is defined in
 * the {@link AggregateFunction} while other methods are explained below.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Processes the input values and update the provided accumulator instance. The method
 * accumulate can be overloaded with different custom types and arguments. An AggregateFunction
 * requires at least one accumulate() method.
 *
 * param: accumulator           the accumulator which contains the current aggregated results
 * param: [user defined inputs] the input value (usually obtained from a new arrived data).
 *
 * public void accumulate(ACC accumulator, [user defined inputs])
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Retracts the input values from the accumulator instance. The current design assumes the
 * inputs are the values that have been previously accumulated. The method retract can be
 * overloaded with different custom types and arguments. This function must be implemented for
 * data stream bounded OVER aggregates.
 *
 * param: accumulator           the accumulator which contains the current aggregated results
 * param: [user defined inputs] the input value (usually obtained from a new arrived data).
 *
 * public void retract(ACC accumulator, [user defined inputs])
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Merges a group of accumulator instances into one accumulator instance. This function must be
 * implemented for data stream session window grouping aggregates and data set grouping aggregates.
 *
 * param: accumulator the accumulator which will keep the merged aggregate results. It should
 *                    be noted that the accumulator may contain the previous aggregated
 *                    results. Therefore user should not replace or clean this instance in the
 *                    custom merge method.
 * param: its         an java.lang.Iterable pointed to a group of accumulators that will be
 *                    merged.
 *
 * public void merge(ACC accumulator, java.lang.Iterable<ACC> iterable)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Resets the accumulator for this AggregateFunction. This function must be implemented for
 * data set grouping aggregates.
 *
 * param: accumulator the accumulator which needs to be reset
 *
 * public void resetAccumulator(ACC accumulator)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If this aggregate function can only be applied in an OVER window, this can be declared using the
 * requirement {@link FunctionRequirement#OVER_WINDOW_ONLY} in {@link #getRequirements()}.
 *
 * @param <T>   the type of the aggregation result
 * @param <ACC> the type of the aggregation accumulator. The accumulator is used to keep the
 *              aggregated values which are needed to compute an aggregation result.
 *              AggregateFunction represents its state using accumulator, thereby the state of the
 *              AggregateFunction must be put into the accumulator.
