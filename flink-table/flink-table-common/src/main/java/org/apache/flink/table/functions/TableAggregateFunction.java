/**
 * Base class for user-defined table aggregates.
 *
 * <p>The behavior of a {@link TableAggregateFunction} can be defined by implementing a series of
 * custom methods. A {@link TableAggregateFunction} needs at least three methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>createAccumulator</li>
 *     <li>accumulate</li>
 *     <li>emitValue or emitUpdateWithRetract</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There is another method that can be optional to have:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>retract</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All these methods must be declared publicly, not static, and named exactly as the names
 * mentioned above. The method {@link #createAccumulator()} is defined in
 * the {@link UserDefinedAggregateFunction} functions, while other methods are explained below.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Processes the input values and update the provided accumulator instance. The method
 * accumulate can be overloaded with different custom types and arguments. A TableAggregateFunction
 * requires at least one accumulate() method.
 *
 * param: accumulator           the accumulator which contains the current aggregated results
 * param: [user defined inputs] the input value (usually obtained from a new arrived data).
 *
 * public void accumulate(ACC accumulator, [user defined inputs])
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Retracts the input values from the accumulator instance. The current design assumes the
 * inputs are the values that have been previously accumulated. The method retract can be
 * overloaded with different custom types and arguments.
 *
 * param: accumulator           the accumulator which contains the current aggregated results
 * param: [user defined inputs] the input value (usually obtained from a new arrived data).
 *
 * public void retract(ACC accumulator, [user defined inputs])
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Called every time when an aggregation result should be materialized. The returned value could
 * be either an early and incomplete result (periodically emitted as data arrive) or the final
 * result of the aggregation.
 *
 * param: accumulator           the accumulator which contains the current aggregated results
 * param: out                   the collector used to output data.
 *
 * public void emitValue(ACC accumulator, Collector<T> out)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Called every time when an aggregation result should be materialized. The returned value could
 * be either an early and incomplete result (periodically emitted as data arrive) or the final
 * result of the aggregation.
 *
 * Different from emitValue, emitUpdateWithRetract is used to emit values that have been updated.
 * This method outputs data incrementally in retract mode, i.e., once there is an update, we have
 * to retract old records before sending new updated ones. The emitUpdateWithRetract method will be
 * used in preference to the emitValue method if both methods are defined in the table aggregate
 * function, because the method is treated to be more efficient than emitValue as it can output
 * values incrementally.
 *
 * param: accumulator           the accumulator which contains the current aggregated results
 * param: out                   the retractable collector used to output data. Use collect method
 *                              to output(add) records and use retract method to retract(delete)
 *                              records.
 *
 * public void emitUpdateWithRetract(ACC accumulator, RetractableCollector<T> out)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T>   the type of the table aggregation result
 * @param <ACC> the type of the table aggregation accumulator. The accumulator is used to keep the
 *              aggregated values which are needed to compute an aggregation result.
 *              TableAggregateFunction represents its state using accumulator, thereby the state of
 *              the TableAggregateFunction must be put into the accumulator.
