/**
 * A CompletedCheckpoint describes a checkpoint after all required tasks acknowledged it (with their state)
 * and that is considered successful. The CompletedCheckpoint class contains all the metadata of the
 * checkpoint, i.e., checkpoint ID, timestamps, and the handles to all states that are part of the
 * checkpoint.
 * 
 * <h2>Size the CompletedCheckpoint Instances</h2>
 * 
 * In most cases, the CompletedCheckpoint objects are very small, because the handles to the checkpoint
 * states are only pointers (such as file paths). However, the some state backend implementations may
 * choose to store some payload data directly with the metadata (for example to avoid many small files).
 * If those thresholds are increased to large values, the memory consumption of the CompletedCheckpoint
 * objects can be significant.
 * 
 * <h2>Externalized Metadata</h2>
 * 
 * The metadata of the CompletedCheckpoint is optionally also persisted in an external storage
 * system. In that case, the checkpoint is called <i>externalized</i>.
 * 
 * <p>Externalized checkpoints have an external pointer, which points to the metadata. For example
 * when externalizing to a file system, that pointer is the file path to the checkpoint's folder
 * or the metadata file. For a state backend that stores metadata in database tables, the pointer
 * could be the table name and row key. The pointer is encoded as a String.
 * 
 * <h2>Externalized Metadata and High-availability</h2>
 * 
 * For high availability setups, the checkpoint metadata must be stored persistent and available
 * as well. The high-availability services that stores the checkpoint ground-truth (meaning what are
 * the latest completed checkpoints in what order) often rely on checkpoints being externalized. That
 * way, those services only store pointers to the externalized metadata, rather than the complete
 * metadata itself (for example ZooKeeper's ZNode payload should ideally be less than megabytes).
