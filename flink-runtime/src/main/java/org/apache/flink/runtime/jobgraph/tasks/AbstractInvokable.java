/**
 * This is the abstract base class for every task that can be executed by a TaskManager.
 * Concrete tasks extend this class, for example the streaming and batch tasks.
 *
 * <p>The TaskManager invokes the {@link #invoke()} method when executing a
 * task. All operations of the task happen in this method (setting up input
 * output stream readers and writers as well as the task's core operation).
 *
 * <p>All classes that extend must offer a constructor {@code MyTask(Environment, TaskStateSnapshot)}.
 * Tasks that are always stateless can, for convenience, also only implement the constructor
 * {@code MyTask(Environment)}.
 *
 * <p><i>Developer note: While constructors cannot be enforced at compile time, we did not yet venture
 * on the endeavor of introducing factories (it is only an internal API after all, and with Java 8,
 * one can use {@code Class::new} almost like a factory lambda.</i>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> There is no constructor that accepts and initial task state snapshot
 * and stores it in a variable. That is on purpose, because the AbstractInvokable itself
 * does not need the state snapshot (only subclasses such as StreamTask do need the state)
 * and we do not want to store a reference indefinitely, thus preventing cleanup of
 * the initial state structure by the Garbage Collector.
 *
 * <p>Any subclass that supports recoverable state and participates in
 * checkpointing needs to override {@link #triggerCheckpointAsync(CheckpointMetaData, CheckpointOptions, boolean)},
 * {@link #triggerCheckpointOnBarrier(CheckpointMetaData, CheckpointOptions, CheckpointMetrics)},
 * {@link #abortCheckpointOnBarrier(long, Throwable)} and {@link #notifyCheckpointComplete(long)}.
