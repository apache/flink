/**
 * Encapsulates the logic to subsume older checkpoints by {@link CompletedCheckpointStore checkpoint
 * stores}. In general, checkpoints should be subsumed whenever state.checkpoints.num-retained is
 * exceeded.
 *
 * <p>Additional considerations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Savepoints must be stored in the same queue to prevent duplicates (@see <a
 *       href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10354">FLINK-10354</a>).
 *   <li>To prevent unlimited queue growth, savepoints are also counted in num-retained together
 *       with checkpoints
 *   <li>Savepoints actual state should NOT be discarded when they are subsumed.
 *   <li>At least one (most recent) checkpoint (not savepoint) should be kept. Otherwise, subsequent
 *       incremental checkpoints may refer to a discarded state (@see <a
 *       href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21351">FLINK-21351</a>).
 *   <li>Except when the job is stopped with savepoint when no future checkpoints will be made.
 * </ul>
