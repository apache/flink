/**
 * Base class that outlines the strategy for asynchronous snapshots. Implementations of this class are typically
 * instantiated with resources that have been created in the synchronous part of a snapshot. Then, the implementation
 * of {@link #callInternal()} is invoked in the asynchronous part. All resources created by this methods should
 * be released by the end of the method. If the created resources are {@link Closeable} objects and can block in calls
 * (e.g. in/output streams), they should be registered with the snapshot's {@link CloseableRegistry} so that the can
 * be closed and unblocked on cancellation. After {@link #callInternal()} ended, {@link #logAsyncSnapshotComplete(long)}
 * is called. In that method, implementations can emit log statements about the duration. At the very end, this class
 * calls {@link #cleanupProvidedResources()}. The implementation of this method should release all provided resources
 * that have been passed into the snapshot from the synchronous part of the snapshot.
 *
 * @param <T> type of the result.
