/**
 * Checkpoint barriers are used to align checkpoints throughout the streaming topology. The
 * barriers are emitted by the sources when instructed to do so by the JobManager. When
 * operators receive a CheckpointBarrier on one of its inputs, it knows that this is the point
 * between the pre-checkpoint and post-checkpoint data.
 *
 * <p>Once an operator has received a checkpoint barrier from all its input channels, it
 * knows that a certain checkpoint is complete. It can trigger the operator specific checkpoint
 * behavior and broadcast the barrier to downstream operators.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the semantic guarantees, may hold off post-checkpoint data until the checkpoint
 * is complete (exactly once).
 *
 * <p>The checkpoint barrier IDs are strictly monotonous increasing.
