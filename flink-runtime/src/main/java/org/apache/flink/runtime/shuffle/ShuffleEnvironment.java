/**
 * Interface for the implementation of shuffle service local environment.
 *
 * <p>Input/Output interface of local shuffle service environment is based on memory {@link Buffer Buffers}. A producer
 * can write shuffle data into the buffers, obtained from the created {@link ResultPartitionWriter ResultPartitionWriters}
 * and a consumer reads the buffers from the created {@link InputGate InputGates}.
 *
 * <h1>Lifecycle management.</h1>
 *
 * <p>The interface contains method's to manage the lifecycle of the local shuffle service environment:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link ShuffleEnvironment#start} must be called before using the shuffle service environment.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ShuffleEnvironment#close} is called to release the shuffle service environment.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h1>Shuffle Input/Output management.</h1>
 *
 * <h2>Result partition management.</h2>
 *
 * <p>The interface implements a factory of result partition writers to produce shuffle data:
 * {@link ShuffleEnvironment#createResultPartitionWriters}. The created writers are grouped per owner.
 * The owner is responsible for the writers' lifecycle from the moment of creation.
 *
 * <p>Partitions are fully released in the following cases:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link ResultPartitionWriter#fail(Throwable)} and {@link ResultPartitionWriter#close()} are called
 *     if the production has failed.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>if {@link ResultPartitionDeploymentDescriptor#isReleasedOnConsumption()} is {@code true} and
 *     {@link ResultPartitionWriter#finish()} and {@link ResultPartitionWriter#close()} are called when the production is done.
 *     The actual release can take some time depending on implementation details,
 *     e.g. if the `end of consumption' confirmation from the consumer is being awaited implicitly.
 *     The partition has to support the {@link ReleaseType#AUTO} in {@link ShuffleDescriptor#getSupportedReleaseTypes()}.</li>
 *     <li>if {@link ResultPartitionDeploymentDescriptor#isReleasedOnConsumption()} is {@code false} and
 *     {@link ShuffleMaster#releasePartitionExternally(ShuffleDescriptor)} and {@link ShuffleEnvironment#releasePartitionsLocally(Collection)},
 *     if it occupies any producer local resources ({@link ShuffleDescriptor#storesLocalResourcesOn()}),
 *     are called outside of the producer thread, e.g. to manage the lifecycle of BLOCKING result partitions
 *     which can outlive their producers. The partition has to support the {@link ReleaseType#MANUAL} in
 *     {@link ShuffleDescriptor#getSupportedReleaseTypes()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The partitions, which currently still occupy local resources, can be queried with
 * {@link ShuffleEnvironment#getPartitionsOccupyingLocalResources}.
 *
 * <h2>Input gate management.</h2>
 *
 * <p>The interface implements a factory for the input gates: {@link ShuffleEnvironment#createInputGates}.
 * The created gates are grouped per owner. The owner is responsible for the gates' lifecycle from the moment of creation.
 *
 * <p>When the input gates are created, it can happen that not all consumed partitions are known at that moment
 * e.g. because their producers have not been started yet. Therefore, the {@link ShuffleEnvironment} provides
 * a method {@link ShuffleEnvironment#updatePartitionInfo} to update them externally, when the producer becomes known.
 * The update mechanism has to be threadsafe because the updated gate can be read concurrently from a different thread.
 *
 * @param <P> type of provided result partition writers
 * @param <G> type of provided input gates
