 * This class is a wrapper over multiple alternative {@link OperatorSubtaskState} that are (partial) substitutes for
 * each other and imposes a priority ordering over all alternatives for the different states which define an order in
 * which the operator should attempt to restore the state from them. One OperatorSubtaskState is considered as the
 * "ground truth" about which state should be represented. Alternatives may be complete or partial substitutes for
 * the "ground truth" with a higher priority (if they had a lower alternative, they would not really be alternatives).
 * Substitution is determined on a per-sub-state basis.
