/**
 * An input gate consumes one or more partitions of a single produced intermediate result.
 *
 * <p> Each intermediate result is partitioned over its producing parallel subtasks; each of these
 * partitions is furthermore partitioned into one or more subpartitions.
 *
 * <p> As an example, consider a map-reduce program, where the map operator produces data and the
 * reduce operator consumes the produced data.

 * <p> In the above example, two map subtasks produce the intermediate result in parallel, resulting
 * in two partitions (Partition 1 and 2). Each of these partitions is further partitioned into two
 * subpartitions -- one for each parallel reduce subtask.
