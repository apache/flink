/**
 * A spillable sub partition starts out in-memory and spills to disk if asked
 * to do so.
 *
 * <p>Buffers for the partition come from a {@link BufferPool}. The buffer pool
 * is also responsible to trigger the release of the buffers if it needs them
 * back. At this point, the spillable sub partition will write all in-memory
 * buffers to disk. All added buffers after that point directly go to disk.
 *
 * <p>This partition type is used for {@link ResultPartitionType#BLOCKING}
 * results that are fully produced before they can be consumed. At the point
 * when they are consumed, the buffers are (i) all in-memory, (ii) currently
 * being spilled to disk, or (iii) completely spilled to disk. Depending on
 * this state, different reader variants are returned (see
 * {@link SpillableSubpartitionView} and {@link SpilledSubpartitionView}).
 *
 * <p>Since the network buffer pool size for outgoing partitions is usually
 * quite small, e.g. via the {@link TaskManagerOptions#NETWORK_BUFFERS_PER_CHANNEL}
 * and {@link TaskManagerOptions#NETWORK_EXTRA_BUFFERS_PER_GATE} parameters
 * for bounded channels or from the default values of
 * {@link TaskManagerOptions#NETWORK_BUFFERS_MEMORY_FRACTION},
 * {@link TaskManagerOptions#NETWORK_BUFFERS_MEMORY_MIN}, and
 * {@link TaskManagerOptions#NETWORK_BUFFERS_MEMORY_MAX}, most spillable partitions
 * will be spilled for real-world data sets.
 *
 * <p>Note on thread safety. Synchronizing on {@code buffers} is used to synchronize
 * writes and reads. Synchronizing on {@code this} is used against concurrent
 * {@link #add(BufferConsumer)} and clean ups {@link #release()} / {@link #finish()} which
 * also are touching {@code spillWriter}. Since we do not want to block reads during
 * spilling, we need those two synchronization. Probably this model could be simplified.
