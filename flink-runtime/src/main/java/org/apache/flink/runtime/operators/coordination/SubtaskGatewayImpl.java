/**
 * Implementation of the {@link OperatorCoordinator.SubtaskGateway} interface that access to
 * subtasks for status and event sending via {@link SubtaskAccess}.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class can be temporarily closed, blocking events from going through,
 * buffering them, and releasing them later. It is used for "alignment" of operator event streams
 * with checkpoint barrier injection, similar to how the input channels are aligned during a common
 * checkpoint.
 *
 * <p>The methods on the critical communication path, including closing/reopening the gateway and
 * sending the operator events, are required to be used in a single-threaded context specified by
 * the {@link #mainThreadExecutor} in {@link #SubtaskGatewayImpl(SubtaskAccess,
 * ComponentMainThreadExecutor, IncompleteFuturesTracker)} in order to avoid race condition.
