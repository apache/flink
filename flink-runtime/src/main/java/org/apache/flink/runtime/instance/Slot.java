 * plus additional fields to track what is currently executed in that slot, or if the slot is still
 * used or disposed (ExecutionGraph gave it back to the pool).
 *
 * <p>In the simplest case, a slot holds a single task ({@link SimpleSlot}). In the more complex
 * case, a slot is shared ({@link SharedSlot}) and contains a set of tasks. Shared slots may contain
 * other shared slots which in turn can hold simple slots. That way, a shared slot may define a tree
