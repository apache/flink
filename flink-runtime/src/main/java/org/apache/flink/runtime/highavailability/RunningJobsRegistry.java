 * A simple registry that tracks if a certain job is pending execution, running, or completed.

 * <p>This registry is used in highly-available setups with multiple master nodes,
 * to determine whether a new leader should attempt to recover a certain job (because the
 * job is still running), or whether the job has already finished successfully (in case of a
 * finite job) and the leader has only been granted leadership because the previous leader
 * quit cleanly after the job was finished.
 *
 * <p>In addition, the registry can help to determine whether a newly assigned leader JobManager
 * should attempt reconciliation with running TaskManagers, or immediately schedule the job from
 * the latest checkpoint/savepoint.
