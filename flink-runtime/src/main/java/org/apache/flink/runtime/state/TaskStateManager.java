/**
 * This interface provides methods to report and retrieve state for a task.

 * operator instances it owns. All operator snapshots from the task are then reported via this
 * interface. A typical implementation will dispatch and forward the reported state information to
 * interested parties such as the checkpoint coordinator or a local state store.
 *
 * <p>This interface also offers the complementary method that provides access to previously saved
 * state of operator instances in the task for restore purposes.
