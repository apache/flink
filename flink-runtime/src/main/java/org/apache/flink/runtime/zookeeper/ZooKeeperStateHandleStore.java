/**
 * State handles backed by ZooKeeper.
 *
 * <p>Added state is persisted via {@link RetrievableStateHandle RetrievableStateHandles},
 * which in turn are written to ZooKeeper. This level of indirection is necessary to keep the
 * amount of data in ZooKeeper small. ZooKeeper is build for data in the KB range whereas
 * state can grow to multiple MBs.
 *
 * <p>State modifications require some care, because it is possible that certain failures bring
 * the state handle backend and ZooKeeper out of sync.
 *
 * <p>ZooKeeper holds the ground truth about state handles, i.e. the following holds:
 *
 * <pre>
 * State handle in ZooKeeper =&gt; State handle exists
 * </pre>
 *
 * But not:
 *
 * <pre>
 * State handle exists =&gt; State handle in ZooKeeper
 * </pre>
 *
 * There can be lingering state handles when failures happen during operation. They
 * need to be cleaned up manually (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2513">
 * FLINK-2513</a> about a possible way to overcome this).
