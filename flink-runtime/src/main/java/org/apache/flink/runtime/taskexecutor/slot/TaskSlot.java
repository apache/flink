/**
 * Container for multiple {@link Task} belonging to the same slot. A {@link TaskSlot} can be in one
 * of the following states:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Free - The slot is empty and not allocated to a job</li>
 *     <li>Releasing - The slot is about to be freed after it has become empty.</li>
 *     <li>Allocated - The slot has been allocated for a job.</li>
 *     <li>Active - The slot is in active use by a job manager which is the leader of the allocating job.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A task slot can only be allocated if it is in state free. An allocated task slot can transition
 * to state active.
 *<p>
 * An active slot allows to add tasks from the respective job and with the correct allocation id.
 * An active slot can be marked as inactive which sets the state back to allocated.
 * <p>
 * An allocated or active slot can only be freed if it is empty. If it is not empty, then it's state
 * can be set to releasing indicating that it can be freed once it becomes empty.
