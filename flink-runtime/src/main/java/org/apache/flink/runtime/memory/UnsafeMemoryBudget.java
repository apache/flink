/**
 * Tracker of memory allocation and release within a custom limit.

 * <p>This memory management in Flink uses the same approach as Java uses to allocate direct memory
 * and release it upon GC but memory here can be also released directly with {@link #releaseMemory(long)}.
 * The memory reservation {@link #reserveMemory(long)} tries firstly to run all phantom cleaners, created with
 * {@link org.apache.flink.core.memory.MemoryUtils#createMemoryGcCleaner(Object, long, Runnable)},
 * for objects which are ready to be garbage collected. If memory is still not available, it triggers GC and
 * continues to process any ready cleaners making {@link #MAX_SLEEPS} attempts before throwing {@link OutOfMemoryError}.
