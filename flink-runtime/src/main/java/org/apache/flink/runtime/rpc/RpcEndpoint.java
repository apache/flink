/**
 * Base class for RPC endpoints. Distributed components which offer remote procedure calls have to
 * extend the RPC endpoint base class. An RPC endpoint is backed by an {@link RpcService}.
 *
 * <h1>Endpoint and Gateway</h1>
 *
 * To be done...
 *
 * <h1>Single Threaded Endpoint Execution </h1>
 *
 * <p>All RPC calls on the same endpoint are called by the same thread (referred to as the
 * endpoint's <i>main thread</i>). Thus, by executing all state changing operations within the main
 * thread, we don't have to reason about concurrent accesses, in the same way in the Actor Model of
 * Erlang or Akka.
 *
 * <p>The RPC endpoint provides {@link #runAsync(Runnable)}, {@link #callAsync(Callable, Time)} and
 * the {@link #getMainThreadExecutor()} to execute code in the RPC endpoint's main thread.
 *
 * <h1>Lifecycle</h1>
 *
 * <p>The RPC endpoint has the following stages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The RPC endpoint is created in a non-running state and does not serve any RPC requests.
 *   <li>Calling the {@link #start()} method triggers the start of the RPC endpoint and schedules
 *       overridable {@link #onStart()} method call to the main thread.
 *   <li>When the start operation ends the RPC endpoint is moved to the running state and starts to
 *       serve and complete RPC requests.
 *   <li>Calling the {@link #closeAsync()} method triggers the termination of the RPC endpoint and
 *       schedules overridable {@link #onStop()} method call to the main thread.
 *   <li>When {@link #onStop()} method is called, it triggers an asynchronous stop operation. The
 *       RPC endpoint is not in the running state anymore but it continues to serve RPC requests.
 *   <li>When the asynchronous stop operation ends, the RPC endpoint terminates completely and does
 *       not serve RPC requests anymore.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The running state can be queried in a RPC method handler or in the main thread by calling {@link
 * #isRunning()} method.
