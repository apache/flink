/**
 * Utility class to store job information on the JobManager. The JobInfo stores which actor
 * submitted the job, when the start time and, if already terminated, the end time was.
 * Additionally, it stores whether the job was started in the detached mode. Detached means that
 * the submitting actor does not wait for the job result once the job has terminated.
 *
 * Important: This class is serializable, but needs to be deserialized in the context of an actor
 * system in order to resolve the client [[ActorRef]]. It is possible to serialize the Akka URL
 * manually, but it is cumbersome and complicates testing in certain scenarios, where you need to
 * make sure to resolve the correct [[ActorRef]]s when submitting jobs (RepointableActorRef vs.
 * RemoteActorRef).
 *
 * @param client Actor which submitted the job
 * @param start Starting time
