[Sample Project in Java]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart/java_api_quickstart.html) and [Sample Project in Scala]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart/scala_api_quickstart.html) are guides to setting up Maven and SBT projects and include simple implementations of a word count application.

[Monitoring Wikipedia Edits]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart/run_example_quickstart.html) is a more complete example of a streaming analytics application.

[Building real-time dashboard applications with Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-real-time-dashboard-applications-with-apache-flink-elasticsearch-and-kibana) is a blog post at elastic.co showing how to build a real-time dashboard solution for streaming data analytics using Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

The [Flink training website](http://dataartisans.github.io/flink-training) from data Artisans has a number of examples. See the hands-on sections, and the exercises.

## Bundled Examples

The Flink sources include a number of examples for both **streaming** ( [java](https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-streaming/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/examples) / [scala](https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-streaming/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/streaming/scala/examples) ) and **batch** ( [java](https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java) / [scala](https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/examples/scala) ). These [instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/batch/examples.html#running-an-example) explain how to run the examples.
