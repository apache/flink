## Bundled Examples

The Flink sources include many examples for Flink's different APIs:

* DataStream applications ({% gh_link flink-examples/flink-examples-streaming/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/examples "Java" %} / {% gh_link flink-examples/flink-examples-streaming/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/streaming/scala/examples "Scala" %}) 
* DataSet applications ({% gh_link flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java "Java" %} / {% gh_link flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/examples/scala "Scala" %})
* Table API / SQL queries ({% gh_link flink-examples/flink-examples-table/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/examples/java "Java" %} / {% gh_link flink-examples/flink-examples-table/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/table/examples/scala "Scala" %})

These [instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/batch/examples.html#running-an-example) explain how to run the examples.

## Examples on the Web

There are also a few blog posts published online that discuss example applications:

* [How to build stateful streaming applications with Apache Flink
](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3293426/big-data/how-to-build-stateful-streaming-applications-with-apache-flink.html) presents an event-driven application implemented with the DataStream API and two SQL queries for streaming analytics.

* [Building real-time dashboard applications with Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-real-time-dashboard-applications-with-apache-flink-elasticsearch-and-kibana) is a blog post at elastic.co showing how to build a real-time dashboard solution for streaming data analytics using Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

* The [Flink training website](https://training.ververica.com/) from Ververica has a number of examples. Check out the hands-on sections and the exercises.
