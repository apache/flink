            <td>Delay between two consecutive restart attempts if <span markdown="span">`restart-strategy`</span> has been set to <span markdown="span">`fixed-delay`</span>. Delaying the retries can be helpful when the program interacts with external systems where for example connections or pending transactions should reach a timeout before re-execution is attempted. It can be specified using Scala's <span markdown="span">`FiniteDuration`</span> notation: "1 min", "20 s"</td>
