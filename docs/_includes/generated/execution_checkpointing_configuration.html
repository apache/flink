In this case, you have to manually clean up the checkpoint state, both the meta data and actual program state.<br /><br />The mode defines how an externalized checkpoint should be cleaned up on job cancellation. If you choose to retain externalized checkpoints on cancellation you have to handle checkpoint clean up manually when you cancel the job as well (terminating with job status <span markdown="span">`JobStatus#CANCELED`</span>).<br /><br />The target directory for externalized checkpoints is configured via <span markdown="span">`state.checkpoints.dir`</span>.</td>
