The "auto" means selecting the property type automatically based on system memory architecture (64 bit for mmap and 32 bit for file). Note that the memory usage of mmap is not accounted by configured memory limits, but some resource frameworks like yarn would track this memory usage and kill the container once memory exceeding some threshold. Also note that this option is experimental and might be changed future.</td>

In credit-based flow control mode, this indicates how many floating credits are shared among all the input channels. The floating buffers are distributed based on backlog (real-time output buffers in the subpartition) feedback, and can help relieve back-pressure caused by unbalanced data distribution among the subpartitions. This value should be increased in case of higher round trip times between nodes and/or larger number of machines in the cluster.</td>
