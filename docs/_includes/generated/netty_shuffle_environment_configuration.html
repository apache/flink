In credit-based flow control mode, this indicates how many floating credits are shared among all the input channels. The floating buffers are distributed based on backlog (real-time output buffers in the subpartition) feedback, and can help relieve back-pressure caused by unbalanced data distribution among the subpartitions. This value should be increased in case of higher round trip times between nodes and/or larger number of machines in the cluster.</td>

This determines how many streaming data exchange channels a TaskManager can have at the same time and how well buffered the channels are. If a job is rejected or you get a warning that the system has not enough buffers available, increase this value or the min/max values below. Also note, that "taskmanager.network.memory.min"` and "taskmanager.network.memory.max" may override this fraction.</td>
