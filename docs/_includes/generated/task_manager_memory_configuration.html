For example, a value of <span markdown="span">`0.8`</span> means that a task manager reserves 80% of its memory (on-heap or off-heap depending on taskmanager.memory.off-heap) for internal data buffers, leaving 20% of free memory for the task manager's heap for objects created by user-defined functions. This parameter is only evaluated, if taskmanager.memory.size is not set.</td>

When <span markdown="span">`taskmanager.memory.off-heap`</span> is set to true, then it is advised that this configuration is also set to true. If this configuration is set to false cleaning up of the allocated off-heap memory happens only when the configured JVM parameter MaxDirectMemorySize is reached by triggering a full GC. For streaming setups, it is highly recommended to set this value to false as the core state backends currently do not use the managed memory.</td>
