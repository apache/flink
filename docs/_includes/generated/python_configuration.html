For each archive file, a target directory is specified. If the target directory name is specified, the archive file will be extracted to a name can directory with the specified name. Otherwise, the archive file will be extracted to a directory with the same name of the archive file. The files uploaded via this option are accessible via relative path. '#' could be used as the separator of the archive file path and the target directory name. Comma (',') could be used as the separator to specify multiple archive files. This option can be used to upload the virtual environment, the data files used in Python UDF. The data files could be accessed in Python UDF, e.g.: f = open('data/data.txt', 'r'). The option is equivalent to the command line option "-pyarch".</td>
