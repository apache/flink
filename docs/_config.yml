# This are the version referenced in the docs. Please only use these variables
# to reference a specific Flink version, because this is the only place where
# we change the version for the complete docs when forking of a release branch
# etc.
# The full version string as referenced in Maven (e.g. 1.2.1)
version: "1.10.0"
# For stable releases, leave the bugfix version out (e.g. 1.2). For snapshot
# release this should be the same as the regular version
version_title: "1.10"
# Branch on Github for this version
github_branch: "release-1.10"

# Plain Scala version is needed for e.g. the Gradle quickstart.
scala_version: "2.11"
# This suffix is appended to the Scala-dependent Maven artifact names
scala_version_suffix: "_2.11"

# Plain flink-shaded version is needed for e.g. the hive connector.
# Please update the shaded_version once new flink-shaded is released.
shaded_version: "8.0"

# Some commonly linked pages (this was more important to have as a variable
# during incubator; by now it should also be fine to hardcode these.)
