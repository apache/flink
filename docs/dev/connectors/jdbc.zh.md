This connector provides a sink that writes data to a JDBC database.

To use it, add the following dependency to your project (along with your JDBC-driver):

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-connector-jdbc{{ site.scala_version_suffix }}</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.version }}</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the streaming connectors are currently __NOT__ part of the binary distribution. See how to link with them for cluster execution [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/dev/projectsetup/dependencies.html).

Created JDBC sink provides at-least-once guarantee.
Effectively exactly-once can be achived using upsert statements or idempotent updates.

Example usage:
{% highlight java %}
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
env
        .fromElements(...)
        .addSink(JdbcSink.sink(
                "insert into books (id, title, author, price, qty) values (?,?,?,?,?)",
                (ps, t) -> {
                    ps.setInt(1, t.id);
                    ps.setString(2, t.title);
                    ps.setString(3, t.author);
                    ps.setDouble(4, t.price);
                    ps.setInt(5, t.qty);
                },
                new JdbcConnectionOptions.JdbcConnectionOptionsBuilder()
                        .withUrl(getDbMetadata().getUrl())
                        .withDriverName(getDbMetadata().getDriverClass())
                        .build()));
env.execute();
{% endhighlight %}
