# Window Join
A window join will join the elements of two streams that share a common key and lie in the same window. These windows can be defined by using a [window assigner]({{ site.baseurl}}/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#window-assigners) and are evaluated on a union of both streams. This is especially important for session window joins, which will be demonstrated below.

The joined elements are then passed to a user-defined `JoinFunction` or `FlatJoinFunction` where the user can perform transformations on the joined elements.

The general usage always looks like the followning:

```java
stream.join(otherStream)
    .where(<KeySelector>)
    .equalTo(<KeySelector>)
    .window(<WindowAssigner>)
    .apply(<JoinFunction>)
```

Some notes on semantics:
- The creation of pairwise combinations of elements of the two streams behaves like an inner-join, meaning elements from one stream will not be emitted if they don't have a corresponding element from the other stream to be joined with.
- Those elements that do get joined will have as their timestamp the largest timestamp that still lies in the respective window. For example a window with `[5, 10)` as its boundaries would result in the joined elements having nine as their timestamp.

In the following section we are going to give an overview over how different kinds of windows can be used for a window join and what the results of those joins would look like using examplary scenarios.

## Tumbling Window
When performing a tumbling window join, all elements with a common key and a common tumbling window are joined as pairwise combinations and passed on to the user-defined function. Because this behaves like an inner join, elements of one stream that do not have elements from another stream in their tumbling window are not emitted!

### Example
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/tumbling-window-join.svg" class="center" style="width: 80%;" />

In our example we are defining a tumbling window with the size of 2 milliseconds, which results in windows of the form `[0,1], [2,3], ...`. The image shows the pairwise combinations of all elements in each window which will be passed on to the user-defined function. You can also see how in the tumbling window `[6,7]` nothing is emitted because no elements from the green stream exist to be joined with the orange elements ⑥ and ⑦.

    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.milliseconds(2)))
    .apply { (e1, e2) => e1 + "," + e2 }
```

## Sliding Window Join
When performing a sliding window join, all elements with a common key and common sliding window are joined are pairwise combinations and passed on to the user-defined function. Elements of one stream that do not have elements from the other stream in the current sliding window are not emitted! Note that some elements might be joined in one sliding window but not in another!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/sliding-window-join.svg" class="center" style="width: 80%;" />

In this example we are using sliding windows with a duration of two milliseconds and slide them by one millisecond, resulting in the sliding windows `[-1, 0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,3], …`.<!-- TODO: Can -1 actually exist?--> The joined elements below the x-axis are the ones that are passed to the user-defined function for each sliding window. Here you can also see how for example the orange ② is joined with the green ③ in the window `[2,3]`, but is not joined with anything in the window `[1,2]`.

    .apply { (e1, e2) => e1 + "," + e2 }

## Session Window Join
When performing a session window join, all elements with the same key that when _"combined"_ fulfill the session criteria are joined in pairwise combinations and passed on to the user-defined function. Again this performs an inner join, so if there is a session window that only contains elements from one stream, no output will be emitted!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/session-window-join.svg" class="center" style="width: 80%;" />

Here we define a session window join where each session is divided by a gap of at least 1ms. There are three sessions, and in the first two sessions the joined elements from both streams are passed to the user-defined function. In the third session there are no elements in the green stream, so ⑧ and ⑨ are not joined!

    .apply (new JoinFunction<Integer, Integer, String> () {
        @Override
        public String join(Integer first, Integer second) {
            return first + "," + second;
        }

# Interval Join
The interval join joins elements of two streams (we'll call them A & B for now) with a common key and where elements of stream B have timestamps that lie in a relative time interval to timestamps of elements in stream A.

This can also expressed a little more formally as 
`b.timestamp ∈ [a.timestamp + lowerBound; a.timestamp + upperBound]` or 
`a.timestamp + lowerBound <= b.timestamp <= a.timestamp + upperBound`

where a and b are elements of A and B that share a common key.

The interval join currently only performs inner joins, meaning that if an element from one stream has no element from the other stream to be joined with, it will not be passed to the user-defined function. 

When joined elements are passed to the user-defined function they have the maximum timestamp of either one of the two elements. The timestamps of either one of those elements can also be accessed via the `ProcessJoinFunction.Context`

Note: The interval join currently only supports event time.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/interval-join.svg" class="center" style="width: 80%;" />

In this example we are joining two streams 'orange' and 'green' with a lower bound of minus two milliseconds and an upper bound of one millisecond. By default those boundaries are inclusive, but `.lowerBoundExclusive()` and / or `.upperBoundExclusive()` can be used to specify different behaviour.

Using the more formal notation again this will translate to 

`orangeElem.ts + lowerBound <= greenElem.ts <= orangeElem.ts + upperBound`

as indicated by the triangles.
