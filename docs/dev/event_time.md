In this section you will learn about writing time-aware Flink programs. Please
take a look at [Timely Stream Processing]({% link
concepts/timely-stream-processing.md %}) to learn about the concepts behind
timely stream processing.

For information about how to use time in Flink programs refer to
[windowing]({% link dev/stream/operators/windows.md %}) and
[ProcessFunction]({% link
dev/stream/operators/process_function.md %}).

Note that in order to use event-time aware operations, the program needs to
either use sources that directly define event time for the data and emit
watermarks themselves, or the program must inject a *Timestamp Assigner &
Watermark Generator* after the sources. Those functions describe how to access
the event timestamps, and what degree of out-of-orderness the event stream
exhibits.

## Where to go next?

* [Generating Watermarks]({% link dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.md
  %}): Shows how to write timestamp assigners and watermark generators, which
  are needed for event-time aware Flink applications.
* [Builtin Watermark Generators]({% link dev/event_timestamp_extractors.md %}):
  Gives an overview of the builtin watermark generators.
* [Debugging Windows & Event Time]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/monitoring/debugging_event_time.html): Show how to debug problems around
  watermarks and timestamps in event-time Flink applications.
