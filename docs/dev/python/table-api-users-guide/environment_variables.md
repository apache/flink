These environment variables will affect the behavior of PyFlink:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="text-left" style="width: 30%">Environment Variable</th>
      <th class="text-center">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>FLINK_HOME</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        PyFlink job will be compiled before submitting and it requires Flink's distribution to compile the job.
        PyFlink's installation package already contains Flink's distribution and it's used by default.
        This environment allows you to specify a custom Flink's distribution.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>PYFLINK_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        The path of the Python interpreter used to launch the Python process when submitting the Python jobs via 
        "flink run" or compiling the Java/Scala jobs containing Python UDFs.
        Equivalent to the configuration option 'python.client.executable'. The priority is as following: 
        <ol>
        <li>The configuration 'python.client.executable' defined in the source code; </li>
        <li>The environment variable PYFLINK_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE; </li>
        <li>The configuration 'python.client.executable' defined in flink-conf.yaml</li>
        </ol>
        If none of above is set, the default Python interpreter 'python' will be used.
