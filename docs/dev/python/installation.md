## Environment Requirements
<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Python version (3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8) is required for PyFlink. Please run the following command to make sure that it meets the requirements:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python --version
# the version printed here must be 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8
{% endhighlight %}

## Environment Setup

Your system may include multiple Python versions, and thus also include multiple Python binary executables. You can run the following
`ls` command to find out what Python binary executables are available in your system:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls /usr/bin/python*
{% endhighlight %}

To satisfy the PyFlink requirement regarding the Python environment version, you can choose to soft link `python` to point to your `python3` interpreter:

{% highlight bash %}
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 python
{% endhighlight %}

In addition to creating a soft link, you can also choose to create a Python virtual environment (`venv`). You can refer to the [Preparing Python Virtual Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/python/faq.html#preparing-python-virtual-environment) documentation page for details on how to achieve that setup.

If you donâ€™t want to use a soft link to change the system's `python` interpreter point to, you can use the configuration way to specify the Python interpreter.
For specifying the Python interpreter used to compile the jobs, you can refer to the [python client executable]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/python/python_config.html#python-client-executable)
For specifying the Python interpreter used to execute the python UDF worker, you can refer to the [python.executable]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/python/python_config.html#python-executable)

## Installation of PyFlink

PyFlink is available through [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/apache-flink/) as a regular Python package and can be installed as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
{% if site.is_stable %}
$ python -m pip install apache-flink {{ site.version }}
{% else %}
$ python -m pip install apache-flink
{% endif %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also build PyFlink from source by following the [development guide]({% link flinkDev/building.md %}#build-pyflink).

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Starting from Flink 1.11, it's also supported to run PyFlink jobs locally on Windows and so you could develop and debug PyFlink jobs on Windows.
