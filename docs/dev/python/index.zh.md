PyFlink is a language for building unified batch and streaming workloads.
This means real-time streaming pipelines, performing exploratory data
analysis at scale, building machine learning pipelines, and creating ETLs for a data platform.
If you're already familiar with Python and libraries such as Pandas, then PyFlink makes it simple
to leverage the full capabilities of the Apache Flink ecosystem.

The PyFlink Table API makes it simple to write powerful relational queries for building reports and
ETL pipelines.
At the same time, the PyFlink DataStream API gives developers access to low-level control over
state and time, unlocking the full power of stream processing.
