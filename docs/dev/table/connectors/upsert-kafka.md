The Upsert Kafka connector allows for reading data from and writing data into Kafka topics in the upsert fashion.

As a source, the upsert-kafka connector produces a changelog stream, where each data record represents
an update or delete event. More precisely, the value in a data record is interpreted as an UPDATE of
the last value for the same key, if any (if a corresponding key doesn’t exist yet, the update will
be considered an INSERT). Using the table analogy, a data record in a changelog stream is interpreted
as an UPSERT aka INSERT/UPDATE because any existing row with the same key is overwritten. Also, null
values are interpreted in a special way: a record with a null value represents a “DELETE”.

As a sink, the upsert-kafka connector can consume a changelog stream. It will write INSERT/UPDATE_AFTER
data as normal Kafka messages value, and write DELETE data as Kafka messages with null values
(indicate tombstone for the key). Flink will guarantee the message ordering on the primary key by
partition data on the values of the primary key columns, so the update/deletion messages on the same
key will fall into the same partition.

Full Example
----------------

The example below shows how to create and use an Upsert Kafka table:

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="SQL" markdown="1">
{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE pageviews_per_region (
  region STRING,
  pv BIGINT,
  uv BIGINT,
  PRIMARY KEY (region) NOT ENFORCED
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'upsert-kafka',
  'topic' = 'pageviews_per_region',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = '...',
  'key.format' = 'avro',
  'value.format' = 'avro'
);

CREATE TABLE pageviews (
  user_id BIGINT,
  page_id BIGINT,
  viewtime TIMESTAMP,
  user_region STRING,
  WATERMARK FOR viewtime AS viewtime - INTERVAL '2' SECOND
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka',
  'topic' = 'pageviews',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = '...',
  'format' = 'json'
);

-- calculate the pv, uv and insert into the upsert-kafka sink
INSERT INTO pageviews_per_region
SELECT
  region,
  COUNT(*),
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM pageviews
GROUP BY region;

         This can set and pass arbitrary Kafka configurations. Suffix names must match the configuration key defined in <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#configuration">Kafka Configuration documentation</a>. Flink will remove the "properties." key prefix and pass the transformed key and values to the underlying KafkaClient. For example, you can disable automatic topic creation via <code>'properties.allow.auto.create.topics' = 'false'</code>. But there are some configurations that do not support to set, because Flink will override them, e.g. <code>'key.deserializer'</code> and <code>'value.deserializer'</code>.

Features
----------------

### Key and Value Formats

See the [regular Kafka connector]({% link dev/connectors/kafka.md %}#key-and-value-formats) for more
explanation around key and value formats. However, note that this connector requires both a key and
value format where the key fields are derived from the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.

The following example shows how to specify and configure key and value formats. The format options are
prefixed with either the `'key'` or `'value'` plus format identifier.

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="SQL" markdown="1">
{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE KafkaTable (
  `ts` TIMESTAMP(3) METADATA FROM 'timestamp',
  `user_id` BIGINT,
  `item_id` BIGINT,
  `behavior` STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`) NOT ENFORCED
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'upsert-kafka',
  ...

  'key.format' = 'json',
  'key.json.ignore-parse-errors' = 'true',

  'value.format' = 'json',
  'value.json.fail-on-missing-field' = 'false',
  'value.fields-include' = 'EXCEPT_KEY'
)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>

### Primary Key Constraints

The Upsert Kafka always works in the upsert fashion and requires to define the primary key in the DDL.
With the assumption that records with the same key should be ordered in the same partition, the
primary key semantic on the changelog source means the materialized changelog is unique on the primary
keys. The primary key definition will also control which fields should end up in Kafka’s key.

### Consistency Guarantees

By default, an Upsert Kafka sink ingests data with at-least-once guarantees into a Kafka topic if
the query is executed with [checkpointing enabled]({% link dev/stream/state/checkpointing.md %}#enabling-and-configuring-checkpointing).

This means, Flink may write duplicate records with the same key into the Kafka topic. But as the
connector is working in the upsert mode, the last record on the same key will take effect when
reading back as a source. Therefore, the upsert-kafka connector achieves idempotent writes just like
the [HBase sink]({% link dev/table/connectors/hbase.md %}).

### Source Per-Partition Watermarks

Flink supports to emit per-partition watermarks for Upsert Kafka. Watermarks are generated inside the Kafka
consumer. The per-partition watermarks are merged in the same way as watermarks are merged during streaming
shuffles. The output watermark of the source is determined by the minimum watermark among the partitions
it reads. If some partitions in the topics are idle, the watermark generator will not advance. You can
alleviate this problem by setting the [`'table.exec.source.idle-timeout'`]({% link dev/table/config.md %}#table-exec-source-idle-timeout)
option in the table configuration.

Please refer to [Kafka watermark strategies]({% link dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.md %}#watermark-strategies-and-the-kafka-connector)
for more details.

Data Type Mapping
----------------

Upsert Kafka stores message keys and values as bytes, so Upsert Kafka doesn't have schema or data types.
The messages are serialized and deserialized by formats, e.g. csv, json, avro. Thus, the data type mapping
is determined by specific formats. Please refer to [Formats]({% link dev/table/connectors/formats/index.md %})
pages for more details.
