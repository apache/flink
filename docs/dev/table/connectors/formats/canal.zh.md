[Canal](https://github.com/alibaba/canal/wiki) is a CDC (Changelog Data Capture) tool that can stream changes in real-time from MySQL into other systems. Canal provides a unified format schema for changelog and supports to serialize messages using JSON and [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (protobuf is the default format for Canal).

Flink supports to interpret Canal JSON messages as INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE messages into Flink SQL system. This is useful in many cases to leverage this feature, such as
 - synchronizing incremental data from databases to other systems
 - auditing logs
 - real-time materialized views on databases
 - temporal join changing history of a database table and so on.

*Note: Support for interpreting Canal protobuf messages and emitting Canal messages is on the roadmap.*

Dependencies
------------

In order to setup the Canal format, the following table provides dependency information for both projects using a build automation tool (such as Maven or SBT) and SQL Client with SQL JAR bundles.

| Maven dependency   | SQL Client JAR         |
| :----------------- | :----------------------|
| `flink-json`       | Built-in               |

*Note: please refer to [Canal documentation](https://github.com/alibaba/canal/wiki) about how to deploy Canal to synchronize changelog to message queues.*


How to use Canal format
----------------

Canal provides a unified format for changelog, here is a simple example for an update operation captured from a MySQL `products` table:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "111",
      "name": "scooter",
      "description": "Big 2-wheel scooter",
      "weight": "5.18"
    }
  ],
  "database": "inventory",
  "es": 1589373560000,
  "id": 9,
  "isDdl": false,
  "mysqlType": {
    "id": "INTEGER",
    "name": "VARCHAR(255)",
    "description": "VARCHAR(512)",
    "weight": "FLOAT"
  },
  "old": [
    {
      "weight": "5.15"
    }
  ],
  "pkNames": [
    "id"
  ],
  "sql": "",
  "sqlType": {
    "id": 4,
    "name": 12,
    "description": 12,
    "weight": 7
  },
  "table": "products",
  "ts": 1589373560798,
  "type": "UPDATE"
}
```

*Note: please refer to [Canal documentation](https://github.com/alibaba/canal/wiki) about the meaning of each fields.*

The MySQL `products` table has 4 columns (`id`, `name`, `description` and `weight`). The above JSON message is an update change event on the `products` table where the `weight` value of the row with `id = 111` is changed from `5.18` to `5.15`.
Assuming the messages have been synchronized to Kafka topic `products_binlog`, then we can use the following DDL to consume this topic and interpret the change events.

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="SQL" markdown="1">
{% highlight sql %}
CREATE TABLE topic_products (
  -- schema is totally the same to the MySQL "products" table
  id BIGINT,
  name STRING,
  description STRING,
  weight DECIMAL(10, 2)
) WITH (
 'connector' = 'kafka',
 'topic' = 'products_binlog',
 'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
 'properties.group.id' = 'testGroup',
 'format' = 'canal-json'  -- using canal-json as the format
)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>

After registering the topic as a Flink table, you can consume the Canal messages as a changelog source.

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="SQL" markdown="1">
{% highlight sql %}
-- a real-time materialized view on the MySQL "products"
-- which calculates the latest average of weight for the same products
SELECT name, AVG(weight) FROM topic_products GROUP BY name;

-- synchronize all the data and incremental changes of MySQL "products" table to
-- Elasticsearch "products" index for future searching
INSERT INTO elasticsearch_products
SELECT * FROM topic_products;
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>


Format Options
----------------

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="text-left" style="width: 25%">Option</th>
        <th class="text-center" style="width: 8%">Required</th>
        <th class="text-center" style="width: 7%">Default</th>
        <th class="text-center" style="width: 10%">Type</th>
        <th class="text-center" style="width: 50%">Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>format</h5></td>
      <td>required</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">(none)</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Specify what format to use, here should be <code>'canal-json'</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><h5>json.ignore-parse-errors</h5></td>
      <td>optional</td>
      <td style="word-wrap: break-word;">false</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>Skip fields and rows with parse errors instead of failing.
      Fields are set to null in case of errors.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Data Type Mapping
----------------

Currently, the Canal format uses JSON format for deserialization. Please refer to [JSON format documentation]({% link dev/table/connectors/formats/json.md %}#data-type-mapping) for more details about the data type mapping.
