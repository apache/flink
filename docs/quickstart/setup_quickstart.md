Get a Flink example program up and running in a few simple steps.

## Setup: Download and Start

Flink runs on __Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows__. To be able to run Flink, the only requirement is to have a working __Java 7.x__ (or higher) installation. Windows users, please take a look at the [Flink on Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/local_setup.html#flink-on-windows) guide which describes how to run Flink on Windows for local setups.

### Download

Download a binary from the [downloads page](http://flink.apache.org/downloads.html). You can pick any Hadoop/Scala combination you like, for instance [Flink for Hadoop 2]({{ site.FLINK_DOWNLOAD_URL_HADOOP2_STABLE }}).

### Start a Local Flink Cluster

1. Go to the download directory.
2. Unpack the downloaded archive.
3. Start Flink.

~~~bash
$ cd ~/Downloads        # Go to download directory
$ tar xzf flink-*.tgz   # Unpack the downloaded archive
$ cd flink-{{site.version}}
$ bin/start-local.sh    # Start Flink
~~~

Check the __JobManager's web frontend__ at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) and make sure everything is up and running. The web frontend should report a single available TaskManager instance.

## Run Example

Now, we are going to run the [SocketTextStreamWordCount example](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.0.0/flink-quickstart/flink-quickstart-java/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/main/java/SocketTextStreamWordCount.java) and read text from a socket and count the number of distinct words.

* First of all, we use **netcat** to start local server via

  ~~~bash
  $ nc -l 9000
  ~~~ 

* Submit the Flink program:

  ~~~bash
  $ bin/flink run examples/streaming/SocketTextStreamWordCount.jar \
    --hostname localhost \
    --port 9000
  Printing result to stdout. Use --output to specify output path.
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Job execution switched to status RUNNING.
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Source: Socket Stream -> Flat Map(1/1) switched to SCHEDULED
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Source: Socket Stream -> Flat Map(1/1) switched to DEPLOYING
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Keyed Aggregation -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to SCHEDULED
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Keyed Aggregation -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to DEPLOYING
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Source: Socket Stream -> Flat Map(1/1) switched to RUNNING
  03/08/2016 17:21:56 Keyed Aggregation -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to RUNNING
  ~~~

  The program connects to the socket and waits for input. You can check the web interface to verify that the job is running as expected:

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-setup/jobmanager-2.png" ><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-setup/jobmanager-2.png" alt="JobManager: Overview (cont'd)"/></a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-setup/jobmanager-3.png" ><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-setup/jobmanager-3.png" alt="JobManager: Running Jobs"/></a>
    </div>
  </div>

* Counts are printed to `stdout`. Monitor the JobManager's output file and write some text in `nc`:

  ~~~bash
  $ nc -l 9000
  lorem ipsum
  ipsum ipsum ipsum
  bye
  ~~~

  The `.out` file will print the counts immediately:

  ~~~bash
  $ tail -f log/flink-*-jobmanager-*.out
  (lorem,1)
  (ipsum,1)
  (ipsum,2)
  (ipsum,3)
  (ipsum,4)
  (bye,1)
  ~~~~

  To **stop** Flink when you're done type:

  ~~~bash
  $ bin/stop-local.sh
  ~~~

  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-setup/setup.gif" ><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-setup/setup.gif" alt="Quickstart: Setup"/></a>

## Next Steps

Check out the [step-by-step example](run_example_quickstart.html) in order to get a first feel of Flink's programming APIs. When you are done with that, go ahead and read the [streaming guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/apis/streaming/).

### Cluster Setup

__Running Flink on a cluster__ is as easy as running it locally. Having __passwordless SSH__ and
__the same directory structure__ on all your cluster nodes lets you use our scripts to control
everything.

1. Copy the unpacked __flink__ directory from the downloaded archive to the same file system path
on each node of your setup.
2. Choose a __master node__ (JobManager) and set the `jobmanager.rpc.address` key in
`conf/flink-conf.yaml` to its IP or hostname. Make sure that all nodes in your cluster have the same
`jobmanager.rpc.address` configured.
3. Add the IPs or hostnames (one per line) of all __worker nodes__ (TaskManager) to the slaves files
in `conf/slaves`.

You can now __start the cluster__ at your master node with `bin/start-cluster.sh`.

The following __example__ illustrates the setup with three nodes (with IP addresses from _10.0.0.1_
to _10.0.0.3_ and hostnames _master_, _worker1_, _worker2_) and shows the contents of the
configuration files, which need to be accessible at the same path on all machines:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 text-center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart_cluster.png" style="width: 85%">
  </div>
<div class="col-md-6">
  <div class="row">
    <p class="lead text-center">
      /path/to/<strong>flink/conf/<br>flink-conf.yaml</strong>
    <pre>jobmanager.rpc.address: 10.0.0.1</pre>
    </p>
  </div>
<div class="row" style="margin-top: 1em;">
  <p class="lead text-center">
    /path/to/<strong>flink/<br>conf/slaves</strong>
  <pre>
10.0.0.2
10.0.0.3</pre>
  </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Have a look at the [Configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/config.html) section of the documentation to see other available configuration options.
For Flink to run efficiently, a few configuration values need to be set.

In particular,

 * the amount of available memory per TaskManager (`taskmanager.heap.mb`),
 * the number of available CPUs per machine (`taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots`),
 * the total number of CPUs in the cluster (`parallelism.default`) and
 * the temporary directories (`taskmanager.tmp.dirs`)


are very important configuration values.

### Flink on YARN

You can easily deploy Flink on your existing __YARN cluster__.

1. Download the __Flink Hadoop2 package__: [Flink with Hadoop 2]({{site.FLINK_DOWNLOAD_URL_HADOOP2_STABLE}})
2. Make sure your __HADOOP_HOME__ (or _YARN_CONF_DIR_ or _HADOOP_CONF_DIR_) __environment variable__ is set to read your YARN and HDFS configuration.
3. Run the __YARN client__ with: `./bin/yarn-session.sh`. You can run the client with options `-n 10 -tm 8192` to allocate 10 TaskManagers with 8GB of memory each.
