In this guide we will start from scratch and go from setting up a Flink project to running
a streaming analysis program on a Flink cluster.

Wikipedia provides an IRC channel where all edits to the wiki are logged. We are going to
read this channel in Flink and count the number of bytes that each user edits within
a given window of time. This is easy enough to implement in a few minutes using Flink, but it will
give you a good foundation from which to start building more complex analysis programs on your own.

## Setting up a Maven Project

We are going to use a Flink Maven Archetype for creating our project stucture. Please
see [Java API Quickstart]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart/java_api_quickstart.html) for more details
about this. For our purposes, the command to run is this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.flink \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=flink-quickstart-java \{% unless site.is_stable %}
    -DarchetypeCatalog=https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ \{% endunless %}
    -DarchetypeVersion={{ site.version }} \
    -DgroupId=wiki-edits \
    -DartifactId=wiki-edits \
    -Dversion=0.1 \
    -Dpackage=wikiedits \
    -DinteractiveMode=false
{% endhighlight %}

You can edit the `groupId`, `artifactId` and `package` if you like. With the above parameters,
Maven will create a project structure that looks like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tree wiki-edits
wiki-edits/
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        │   └── wikiedits
        │       ├── BatchJob.java
        │       ├── SocketTextStreamWordCount.java
        │       ├── StreamingJob.java
        │       └── WordCount.java
        └── resources
            └── log4j.properties
{% endhighlight %}

There is our `pom.xml` file that already has the Flink dependencies added in the root directory and
several example Flink programs in `src/main/java`. We can delete the example programs, since
we are going to start from scratch:

{% highlight bash %}
$ rm wiki-edits/src/main/java/wikiedits/*.java
{% endhighlight %}

As a last step we need to add the Flink Wikipedia connector as a dependency so that we can
use it in our program. Edit the `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml` so that it looks like this:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
        <artifactId>flink-java</artifactId>
        <version>${flink.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
        <artifactId>flink-streaming-java_2.11</artifactId>
        <version>${flink.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
        <artifactId>flink-clients_2.11</artifactId>
        <version>${flink.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
        <artifactId>flink-connector-wikiedits_2.11</artifactId>
        <version>${flink.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the `flink-connector-wikiedits_2.11` dependency that was added. (This example and
the Wikipedia connector were inspired by the *Hello Samza* example of Apache Samza.)

## Writing a Flink Program

It's coding time. Fire up your favorite IDE and import the Maven project or open a text editor and
create the file `src/main/java/wikiedits/WikipediaAnalysis.java`:

{% highlight java %}
package wikiedits;

public class WikipediaAnalysis {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The program is very basic now, but we will fill it in as we go. Note that I'll not give
import statements here since IDEs can add them automatically. At the end of this section I'll show
the complete code with import statements if you simply want to skip ahead and enter that in your
editor.

The first step in a Flink program is to create a `StreamExecutionEnvironment`
(or `ExecutionEnvironment` if you are writing a batch job). This can be used to set execution
parameters and create sources for reading from external systems. So let's go ahead and add
this to the main method:

{% highlight java %}
StreamExecutionEnvironment see = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
{% endhighlight %}

Next we will create a source that reads from the Wikipedia IRC log:

{% highlight java %}
DataStream<WikipediaEditEvent> edits = see.addSource(new WikipediaEditsSource());
{% endhighlight %}

This creates a `DataStream` of `WikipediaEditEvent` elements that we can further process. For
the purposes of this example we are interested in determining the number of added or removed
bytes that each user causes in a certain time window, let's say five seconds. For this we first
have to specify that we want to key the stream on the user name, that is to say that operations
on this stream should take the user name into account. In our case the summation of edited bytes in the windows
should be per unique user. For keying a Stream we have to provide a `KeySelector`, like this:

{% highlight java %}
KeyedStream<WikipediaEditEvent, String> keyedEdits = edits
    .keyBy(new KeySelector<WikipediaEditEvent, String>() {
        @Override
        public String getKey(WikipediaEditEvent event) {
            return event.getUser();
        }
    });
{% endhighlight %}

This gives us a Stream of `WikipediaEditEvent` that has a `String` key, the user name.
We can now specify that we want to have windows imposed on this stream and compute a
result based on elements in these windows. A window specifies a slice of a Stream
on which to perform a computation. Windows are required when computing aggregations
on an infinite stream of elements. In our example we will say
that we want to aggregate the sum of edited bytes for every five seconds:

{% highlight java %}
DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> result = keyedEdits
    .timeWindow(Time.seconds(5))
    .fold(new Tuple2<>("", 0L), new FoldFunction<WikipediaEditEvent, Tuple2<String, Long>>() {
        @Override
        public Tuple2<String, Long> fold(Tuple2<String, Long> acc, WikipediaEditEvent event) {
            acc.f0 = event.getUser();
            acc.f1 += event.getByteDiff();
            return acc;
        }
    });
{% endhighlight %}

The first call, `.timeWindow()`, specifies that we want to have tumbling (non-overlapping) windows
of five seconds. The second call specifies a *Fold transformation* on each window slice for
each unique key. In our case we start from an initial value of `("", 0L)` and add to it the byte
difference of every edit in that time window for a user. The resulting Stream now contains
a `Tuple2<String, Long>` for every user which gets emitted every five seconds.

The only thing left to do is print the stream to the console and start execution:

{% highlight java %}
result.print();

see.execute();
{% endhighlight %}

That last call is necessary to start the actual Flink job. All operations, such as creating
sources, transformations and sinks only build up a graph of internal operations. Only when
`execute()` is called is this graph of operations thrown on a cluster or executed on your local
machine.

The complete code so far is this:

{% highlight java %}
package wikiedits;

import org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.FoldFunction;
import org.apache.flink.api.java.functions.KeySelector;
import org.apache.flink.api.java.tuple.Tuple2;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.KeyedStream;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.environment.StreamExecutionEnvironment;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.windowing.time.Time;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.wikiedits.WikipediaEditEvent;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.wikiedits.WikipediaEditsSource;

public class WikipediaAnalysis {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    StreamExecutionEnvironment see = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

    DataStream<WikipediaEditEvent> edits = see.addSource(new WikipediaEditsSource());

    KeyedStream<WikipediaEditEvent, String> keyedEdits = edits
      .keyBy(new KeySelector<WikipediaEditEvent, String>() {
        @Override
        public String getKey(WikipediaEditEvent event) {
          return event.getUser();
        }
      });

    DataStream<Tuple2<String, Long>> result = keyedEdits
      .timeWindow(Time.seconds(5))
      .fold(new Tuple2<>("", 0L), new FoldFunction<WikipediaEditEvent, Tuple2<String, Long>>() {
        @Override
        public Tuple2<String, Long> fold(Tuple2<String, Long> acc, WikipediaEditEvent event) {
          acc.f0 = event.getUser();
          acc.f1 += event.getByteDiff();
          return acc;
        }
      });

    result.print();

    see.execute();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can run this example in your IDE or on the command line, using Maven:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mvn clean package
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=wikiedits.WikipediaAnalysis
{% endhighlight %}

The first command builds our project and the second executes our main class. The output should be
similar to this:

{% highlight bash %}
1> (Fenix down,114)
6> (AnomieBOT,155)
8> (BD2412bot,-3690)
7> (IgnorantArmies,49)
3> (Ckh3111,69)
5> (Slade360,0)
7> (Narutolovehinata5,2195)
6> (Vuyisa2001,79)
4> (Ms Sarah Welch,269)
4> (KasparBot,-245)
{% endhighlight %}

The number in front of each line tells you on which parallel instance of the print sink the output
was produced.

This should get you started with writing your own Flink programs. To learn more 
you can check out our guides
about [basic concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/api_concepts.html) and the
[DataStream API]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/datastream_api.html). Stick
around for the bonus exercise if you want to learn about setting up a Flink cluster on
your own machine and writing results to [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org).

## Bonus Exercise: Running on a Cluster and Writing to Kafka

Please follow our [setup quickstart](setup_quickstart.html) for setting up a Flink distribution
on your machine and refer to the [Kafka quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart)
for setting up a Kafka installation before we proceed.

As a first step, we have to add the Flink Kafka connector as a dependency so that we can
use the Kafka sink. Add this to the `pom.xml` file in the dependencies section:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
    <artifactId>flink-connector-kafka-0.8_2.11</artifactId>
    <version>${flink.version}</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we need to modify our program. We'll remove the `print()` sink and instead use a
Kafka sink. The new code looks like this:

{% highlight java %}

result
    .map(new MapFunction<Tuple2<String,Long>, String>() {
        @Override
        public String map(Tuple2<String, Long> tuple) {
            return tuple.toString();
        }
    })
    .addSink(new FlinkKafkaProducer08<>("localhost:9092", "wiki-result", new SimpleStringSchema()));
{% endhighlight %}

The related classes also need to be imported:
{% highlight java %}
import org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaProducer08;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.util.serialization.SimpleStringSchema;
import org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.MapFunction;
{% endhighlight %}

Note how we first transform the Stream of `Tuple2<String, Long>` to a Stream of `String` using
a MapFunction. We are doing this because it is easier to write plain strings to Kafka. Then,
we create a Kafka sink. You might have to adapt the hostname and port to your setup. `"wiki-result"`
is the name of the Kafka stream that we are going to create next, before running our program.
Build the project using Maven because we need the jar file for running on the cluster:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mvn clean package
{% endhighlight %}

The resulting jar file will be in the `target` subfolder: `target/wiki-edits-0.1.jar`. We'll use
this later.

Now we are ready to launch a Flink cluster and run the program that writes to Kafka on it. Go
to the location where you installed Flink and start a local cluster:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd my/flink/directory
$ bin/start-local.sh
{% endhighlight %}

We also have to create the Kafka Topic, so that our program can write to it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd my/kafka/directory
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic wiki-results
{% endhighlight %}

Now we are ready to run our jar file on the local Flink cluster:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd my/flink/directory
$ bin/flink run -c wikiedits.WikipediaAnalysis path/to/wikiedits-0.1.jar
{% endhighlight %}

The output of that command should look similar to this, if everything went according to plan:

```
03/08/2016 15:09:27 Job execution switched to status RUNNING.
03/08/2016 15:09:27 Source: Custom Source(1/1) switched to SCHEDULED
03/08/2016 15:09:27 Source: Custom Source(1/1) switched to DEPLOYING
03/08/2016 15:09:27 TriggerWindow(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows(5000), FoldingStateDescriptor{name=window-contents, defaultValue=(,0), serializer=null}, ProcessingTimeTrigger(), WindowedStream.fold(WindowedStream.java:207)) -> Map -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to SCHEDULED
03/08/2016 15:09:27 TriggerWindow(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows(5000), FoldingStateDescriptor{name=window-contents, defaultValue=(,0), serializer=null}, ProcessingTimeTrigger(), WindowedStream.fold(WindowedStream.java:207)) -> Map -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to DEPLOYING
03/08/2016 15:09:27 TriggerWindow(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows(5000), FoldingStateDescriptor{name=window-contents, defaultValue=(,0), serializer=null}, ProcessingTimeTrigger(), WindowedStream.fold(WindowedStream.java:207)) -> Map -> Sink: Unnamed(1/1) switched to RUNNING
03/08/2016 15:09:27 Source: Custom Source(1/1) switched to RUNNING
```

You can see how the individual operators start running. There are only two, because
the operations after the window get folded into one operation for performance reasons. In Flink
we call this *chaining*.

You can observe the output of the program by inspecting the Kafka topic using the Kafka
console consumer:

{% highlight bash %}
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh  --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic wiki-result
{% endhighlight %}

You can also check out the Flink dashboard which should be running at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
You get an overview of your cluster resources and running jobs:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-example/jobmanager-overview.png" ><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-example/jobmanager-overview.png" alt="JobManager Overview"/></a>

If you click on your running job you will get a view where you can inspect individual operations
and, for example, see the number of processed elements:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-example/jobmanager-job.png" ><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/page/img/quickstart-example/jobmanager-job.png" alt="Example Job View"/></a>

This concludes our little tour of Flink. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask on our [Mailing Lists](http://flink.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists).
