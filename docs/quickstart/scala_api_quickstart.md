## Build Tools

Flink projects can be built with different build tools.
In order to get quickly started, Flink provides project templates for the following build tools:

- [SBT](#sbt)
- [Maven](#maven)

These templates help you to set up the project structure and to create the initial build files.

## SBT

### Create Project

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" style="border-bottom: none;">
    <li class="active"><a href="#giter8" data-toggle="tab">Use <strong>Giter8</strong></a></li>
    <li><a href="#clone-repository" data-toggle="tab">Clone <strong>repository</strong></a></li>
    <li><a href="#quickstart-script-sbt" data-toggle="tab">Run the <strong>quickstart script</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane active" id="giter8">
    {% highlight bash %}
    $ g8 tillrohrmann/flink-project
    {% endhighlight %}
    This will create a Flink project in the <strong>specified</strong> project directory from the <a href="https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink-project.g8">flink-project template</a>.
    If you haven't installed <a href="https://github.com/n8han/giter8">giter8</a>, then please follow this <a href="https://github.com/n8han/giter8#installation">installation guide</a>.
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="clone-repository">
    {% highlight bash %}
    $ git clone https://github.com/tillrohrmann/flink-project.git
    {% endhighlight %}
    This will create the Flink project in the directory <strong>flink-project</strong>.
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="quickstart-script-sbt">
    {% highlight bash %}
    $ bash <(curl https://flink.apache.org/q/sbt-quickstart.sh)
    {% endhighlight %}
    This will create a Flink project in the <strong>specified</strong> project directory.
    </div>
</div>

### Build Project

In order to build your project you simply have to issue the `sbt clean assembly` command.
This will create the fat-jar __your-project-name-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar__ in the directory __target/scala_your-major-scala-version/__.

### Run Project

In order to run your project you have to issue the `sbt run` command.

Per default, this will run your job in the same JVM as `sbt` is running.
In order to run your job in a distinct JVM, add the following line to `build.sbt`

~~~scala
fork in run := true
~~~


#### IntelliJ

We recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for your Flink job development.
In order to get started, you have to import your newly created project into IntelliJ.
You can do this via `File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources...` and then choosing your project's directory.
IntelliJ will then automatically detect the `build.sbt` file and set everything up.

In order to run your Flink job, it is recommended to choose the `mainRunner` module as the classpath of your __Run/Debug Configuration__.
This will ensure, that all dependencies which are set to _provided_ will be available upon execution.
You can configure the __Run/Debug Configurations__ via `Run -> Edit Configurations...` and then choose `mainRunner` from the _Use classpath of module_ dropbox.

#### Eclipse

In order to import the newly created project into [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), you first have to create Eclipse project files for it.
These project files can be created via the [sbteclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse) plugin.
Add the following line to your `PROJECT_DIR/project/plugins.sbt` file:

~~~bash
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "4.0.0")
~~~

In `sbt` use the following command to create the Eclipse project files

~~~bash
> eclipse
~~~

Now you can import the project into Eclipse via `File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace` and then select the project directory.

## Maven

### Requirements

The only requirements are working __Maven 3.0.4__ (or higher) and __Java 7.x__ (or higher) installations.


### Create Project

Use one of the following commands to __create a project__:

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" style="border-bottom: none;">
    <li class="active"><a href="#maven-archetype" data-toggle="tab">Use <strong>Maven archetypes</strong></a></li>
    <li><a href="#quickstart-script" data-toggle="tab">Run the <strong>quickstart script</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane active" id="maven-archetype">
    {% highlight bash %}
    $ mvn archetype:generate                               \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.flink              \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=flink-quickstart-scala     \
      -DarchetypeVersion={{site.version}}
    {% endhighlight %}
    This allows you to <strong>name your newly created project</strong>. It will interactively ask you for the groupId, artifactId, and package name.
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="quickstart-script">
{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://flink.apache.org/q/quickstart-scala.sh | bash
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
</div>


### Inspect Project

There will be a new directory in your working directory. If you've used the _curl_ approach, the directory is called `quickstart`. Otherwise, it has the name of your artifactId.

The sample project is a __Maven project__, which contains four classes. _StreamingJob_ and _BatchJob_ are basic skeleton programs, _SocketTextStreamWordCount_ is a working streaming example and _WordCountJob_ is a working batch example. Please note that the _main_ method of all classes allow you to start Flink in a development/testing mode.

We recommend you __import this project into your IDE__. For Eclipse, you need the following plugins, which you can install from the provided Eclipse Update Sites:

* _Eclipse 4.x_
  * [Scala IDE](http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e38/scala210/stable/site)
  * [m2eclipse-scala](http://alchim31.free.fr/m2e-scala/update-site)
  * [Build Helper Maven Plugin](https://repository.sonatype.org/content/repositories/forge-sites/m2e-extras/0.15.0/N/0.15.0.201206251206/)
* _Eclipse 3.7_
  * [Scala IDE](http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e37/scala210/stable/site)
  * [m2eclipse-scala](http://alchim31.free.fr/m2e-scala/update-site)
  * [Build Helper Maven Plugin](https://repository.sonatype.org/content/repositories/forge-sites/m2e-extras/0.14.0/N/0.14.0.201109282148/)

The IntelliJ IDE also supports Maven and offers a plugin for Scala development.


### Build Project

If you want to __build your project__, go to your project directory and issue the `mvn clean package -Pbuild-jar` command. You will __find a jar__ that runs on every Flink cluster in __target/your-artifact-id-{{ site.version }}.jar__. There is also a fat-jar,  __target/your-artifact-id-{{ site.version }}-flink-fat-jar.jar__. This
also contains all dependencies that get added to the maven project.

## Next Steps

Write your application!

The quickstart project contains a WordCount implementation, the "Hello World" of Big Data processing systems. The goal of WordCount is to determine the frequencies of words in a text, e.g., how often do the terms "the" or "house" occur in all Wikipedia texts.

__Sample Input__:

~~~bash
big data is big
~~~

__Sample Output__:

~~~bash
big 2
data 1
is 1
~~~

The following code shows the WordCount implementation from the Quickstart which processes some text lines with two operators (FlatMap and Reduce), and prints the resulting words and counts to std-out.

~~~scala
object WordCountJob {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    // set up the execution environment
    val env = ExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment

    // get input data
    val text = env.fromElements("To be, or not to be,--that is the question:--",
      "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer", "The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune",
      "Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,")

    val counts = text.flatMap { _.toLowerCase.split("\\W+") }
      .map { (_, 1) }
      .groupBy(0)
      .sum(1)

    // emit result
    counts.print()
  }
}
