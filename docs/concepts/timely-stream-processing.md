## Time

When referring to time in a streaming program (for example to define windows),
one can refer to different notions of time:

  - **Event Time** is the time when an event was created. It is usually
    described by a timestamp in the events, for example attached by the
    producing sensor, or the producing service. Flink accesses event timestamps
    via [timestamp assigners]({{ site.baseurl
    }}/dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.html).

  - **Ingestion time** is the time when an event enters the Flink dataflow at
    the source operator.

  - **Processing Time** is the local time at each operator that performs a
    time-based operation.

More details on how to handle time are in the [event time docs]({{ site.baseurl
}}{% link dev/event_time.md %}).

## Windows

Aggregating events (e.g., counts, sums) works differently on streams than in
batch processing.  For example, it is impossible to count all elements in a
stream, because streams are in general infinite (unbounded). Instead,
aggregates on streams (counts, sums, etc), are scoped by **windows**, such as
*"count over the last 5 minutes"*, or *"sum of the last 100 elements"*.

Windows can be *time driven* (example: every 30 seconds) or *data driven*
(example: every 100 elements).  One typically distinguishes different types of
windows, such as *tumbling windows* (no overlap), *sliding windows* (with
overlap), and *session windows* (punctuated by a gap of inactivity).

More window examples can be found in this [blog
post](https://flink.apache.org/news/2015/12/04/Introducing-windows.html).  More
details are in the [window docs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
