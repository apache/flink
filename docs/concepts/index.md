The [Hands-on Training]({% link training/index.md %}) explains the basic concepts
of stateful and timely stream processing that underlie Flink's APIs, and provides examples of how
these mechanisms are used in applications. Stateful stream processing is introduced in the context
of [Data Pipelines & ETL]({% link training/etl.md %}#stateful-transformations)
and is further developed in the section on [Fault Tolerance]({% link
training/fault_tolerance.md %}). Timely stream processing is introduced in the section on
[Streaming Analytics]({% link training/streaming_analytics.md %}).

This _Concepts in Depth_ section provides a deeper understanding of how Flink's architecture and runtime 
implement these concepts.

## Flink's APIs

Flink offers different levels of abstraction for developing streaming/batch applications.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/levels_of_abstraction.svg" alt="Programming levels of abstraction" class="offset" width="80%" />

  - The lowest level abstraction simply offers **stateful and timely stream processing**. It is
    embedded into the [DataStream API]({% link dev/datastream_api.md %}) via the [Process
    Function]({% link dev/stream/operators/process_function.md %}). It allows
    users to freely process events from one or more streams, and provides consistent, fault tolerant
    *state*. In addition, users can register event time and processing time callbacks, allowing
    programs to realize sophisticated computations.

  - In practice, many applications do not need the low-level
    abstractions described above, and can instead program against the **Core APIs**: the
    [DataStream API]({% link dev/datastream_api.md %})
    (bounded/unbounded streams) and the [DataSet API]({% link
    dev/batch/index.md %}) (bounded data sets). These fluent APIs offer the
    common building blocks for data processing, like various forms of
    user-specified transformations, joins, aggregations, windows, state, etc.
    Data types processed in these APIs are represented as classes in the
    respective programming languages.

    The low level *Process Function* integrates with the *DataStream API*,
    making it possible to use the lower-level abstraction on an as-needed basis. 
    The *DataSet API* offers additional primitives on bounded data sets,
    like loops/iterations.

  - The **Table API** is a declarative DSL centered around *tables*, which may
    be dynamically changing tables (when representing streams).  The [Table
    API]({% link dev/table/index.md %}) follows the
    (extended) relational model: Tables have a schema attached (similar to
    tables in relational databases) and the API offers comparable operations,
    such as select, project, join, group-by, aggregate, etc.  Table API
    programs declaratively define *what logical operation should be done*
    rather than specifying exactly *how the code for the operation looks*.
    Though the Table API is extensible by various types of user-defined
    functions, it is less expressive than the *Core APIs*, and more concise to
    use (less code to write).  In addition, Table API programs also go through
    an optimizer that applies optimization rules before execution.

    One can seamlessly convert between tables and *DataStream*/*DataSet*,
    allowing programs to mix the *Table API* with the *DataStream* and
    *DataSet* APIs.

  - The highest level abstraction offered by Flink is **SQL**. This abstraction
    is similar to the *Table API* both in semantics and expressiveness, but
    represents programs as SQL query expressions.  The [SQL]({{ site.baseurl
    }}{% link dev/table/index.md %}#sql) abstraction closely interacts with the
    Table API, and SQL queries can be executed over tables defined in the
    *Table API*.
