## Anatomy of a Flink Cluster

`TODO: expand this section, especially about components of the Flink Master and
container environments`

The Flink runtime consists of two types of processes:

  - The *Flink Master* coordinates the distributed execution. It schedules
    tasks, coordinates checkpoints, coordinates recovery on failures, etc.

    There is always at least one *Flink Master*. A high-availability setup
    might have multiple *Flink Masters*, one of which is always the
    *leader*, and the others are *standby*.

  - The *TaskManagers* (also called *workers*) execute the *tasks* (or more
    specifically, the subtasks) of a dataflow, and buffer and exchange the data
    *streams*.

    There must always be at least one TaskManager.

The Flink Master and TaskManagers can be started in various ways: directly on
the machines as a [standalone cluster]({% link
ops/deployment/cluster_setup.md %}), in containers, or managed by resource
frameworks like [YARN]({% link ops/deployment/yarn_setup.md
%}) or [Mesos]({% link ops/deployment/mesos.md %}).
TaskManagers connect to Flink Masters, announcing themselves as available, and
are assigned work.

The *client* is not part of the runtime and program execution, but is used to
prepare and send a dataflow to the Flink Master.  After that, the client can
disconnect, or stay connected to receive progress reports. The client runs
either as part of the Java/Scala program that triggers the execution, or in the
command line process `./bin/flink run ...`.

## Tasks and Operator Chains

For distributed execution, Flink *chains* operator subtasks together into
*tasks*. Each task is executed by one thread.  Chaining operators together into
tasks is a useful optimization: it reduces the overhead of thread-to-thread
handover and buffering, and increases overall throughput while decreasing
latency.  The chaining behavior can be configured; see the [chaining docs]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link dev/stream/operators/index.md
%}#task-chaining-and-resource-groups) for details.

The sample dataflow in the figure below is executed with five subtasks, and
hence with five parallel threads.

## Task Slots and Resources

Each worker (TaskManager) is a *JVM process*, and may execute one or more
subtasks in separate threads.  To control how many tasks a worker accepts, a
worker has so called **task slots** (at least one).

Each *task slot* represents a fixed subset of resources of the TaskManager. A
TaskManager with three slots, for example, will dedicate 1/3 of its managed
memory to each slot. Slotting the resources means that a subtask will not
compete with subtasks from other jobs for managed memory, but instead has a
certain amount of reserved managed memory. Note that no CPU isolation happens
here; currently slots only separate the managed memory of tasks.

By adjusting the number of task slots, users can define how subtasks are
isolated from each other.  Having one slot per TaskManager means that each task
group runs in a separate JVM (which can be started in a separate container, for
example). Having multiple slots means more subtasks share the same JVM. Tasks
in the same JVM share TCP connections (via multiplexing) and heartbeat
messages. They may also share data sets and data structures, thus reducing the
per-task overhead.

By default, Flink allows subtasks to share slots even if they are subtasks of
different tasks, so long as they are from the same job. The result is that one
slot may hold an entire pipeline of the job. Allowing this *slot sharing* has
two main benefits:

  - A Flink cluster needs exactly as many task slots as the highest parallelism
    used in the job.  No need to calculate how many tasks (with varying
    parallelism) a program contains in total.

  - It is easier to get better resource utilization. Without slot sharing, the
    non-intensive *source/map()* subtasks would block as many resources as the
    resource intensive *window* subtasks.  With slot sharing, increasing the
    base parallelism in our example from two to six yields full utilization of
    the slotted resources, while making sure that the heavy subtasks are fairly
    distributed among the TaskManagers.
