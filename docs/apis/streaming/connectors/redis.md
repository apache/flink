This connector provides access to data streams from [Redis PubSub](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub). To use this connector, add the following dependency to your project:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-connector-redis{{ site.scala_version_suffix }}</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.version }}</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the streaming connectors are currently not part of the binary distribution. See linking with them for cluster execution [here]({{site.baseurl}}/apis/cluster_execution.html#linking-with-modules-not-contained-in-the-binary-distribution).

#### Installing Redis
Follow the instructions from the [Redis download page](http://redis.io/download).

#### Redis Sink
A class providing an interface for sending data to Redis. It internally sends data to redis

4. Serialization schema

Example:

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="java" markdown="1">
{% highlight java %}
stream.addSink(new RedisSink<String>("localhost", 6379, "hello", new SimpleStringSchema()));
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div data-lang="scala" markdown="1">
{% highlight scala %}
stream.addSink(new RedisSink[String]("localhost", 6379, "hello", new SimpleStringSchema))
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>
