This connector provides sinks that writes data into a [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) database.

To use this connector, add the following dependency to your project:

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-connector-cassandra{{ site.scala_version_suffix }}</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.version }}</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the streaming connectors are currently not part of the binary distribution. See how to link with them for cluster execution [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/apis/cluster_execution.html#linking-with-modules-not-contained-in-the-binary-distribution).

#### Installing Apache Cassandra
Follow the instructions from the [Cassandra Getting Started page](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted).

#### Cassandra Sink

Flink's Cassandra sink are created by using the static CassandraSink.addSink(DataStream<IN> input) method.
This method returns a CassandraSinkBuilder, which offers methods to further configure the sink.

The following configuration methods can be used:

1. setQuery(String query)
2. setConsistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel level)
3. setClusterBuilder(ClusterBuilder builder)
4. setCheckpointCommitter(CheckpointCommitter committer)
5. build()

setQuery() sets the query that is executed for every value the sink receives.
setConsistencyLevel() sets the desired consistency level (AT_LEAST_ONCE / EXACTLY_ONCE).
setClusterBuilder() sets the cluster builder that is used to configure the connection to cassandra.
setCheckpointCommitter() is an optional method for EXACTLY_ONCE processing.

A checkpoint committer stores additional information about completed checkpoints
in some resource. You can use a `CassandraCommitter` to store these in a separate
table in cassandra. Note that this table will NOT be cleaned up by Flink.

build() finalizes the configuration and returns the CassandraSink.

Example:

<div class="codetabs" markdown="1">
<div data-lang="java" markdown="1">
{% highlight java %}
CassandraSink.addSink(input)
  .setQuery("INSERT INTO example.values (id, counter) values (?, ?);")
  .setConsistencyLevel(CassandraSink.ConsistencyLevel.EXACTLY_ONCE)
  .setCheckpointCommitter(new CassandraCommitter())
  .setClusterBuilder(new ClusterBuilder() {
    @Override
    public Cluster buildCluster(Cluster.Builder builder) {
      return builder.addContactPoint("127.0.0.1").build();
    }
  })
  .build();
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div data-lang="scala" markdown="1">
{% highlight scala %}
CassandraSink.addSink(input)
  .setQuery("INSERT INTO example.values (id, counter) values (?, ?);")
  .setConsistencyLevel(CassandraSink.ConsistencyLevel.EXACTLY_ONCE)
  .setCheckpointCommitter(new CassandraCommitter())
  .setClusterBuilder(new ClusterBuilder() {
    @Override
    public Cluster buildCluster(Cluster.Builder builder) {
      return builder.addContactPoint("127.0.0.1").build();
    }
  })
  .build();
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
