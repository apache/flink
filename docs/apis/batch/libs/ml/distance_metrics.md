## Description

Different metrics of distance are convenient for different types of analysis. Flink ML provides
built-in implementations for many standard distance metrics. You can create custom
distance metrics by implementing the `DistanceMetric` trait.

## Built-in Implementations

Currently, FlinkML supports the following metrics:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="text-left" style="width: 20%">Metric</th>
        <th class="text-center">Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Euclidean Distance</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i - y_i \right)^2}$$
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Squared Euclidean Distance</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i - y_i \right)^2$$
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Cosine Similarity</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = 1 - \frac{\x^T \y}{\Vert \x \Vert \Vert \y \Vert}$$
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Chebyshev Distance</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = \max_{i}\left(\left \vert x_i - y_i \right\vert \right)$$
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Manhattan Distance</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left\vert x_i - y_i \right\vert$$
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Minkowski Distance</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i - y_i \right)^p \right)^{\rfrac{1}{p}}$$
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Tanimoto Distance</strong></td>
        <td>
          $$d(\x, \y) = 1 - \frac{\x^T\y}{\Vert \x \Vert^2 + \Vert \y \Vert^2 - \x^T\y}$$ 
          with $\x$ and $\y$ being bit-vectors
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

## Custom Implementation

You can create your own distance metric by implementing the `DistanceMetric` trait.

{% highlight scala %}
class MyDistance extends DistanceMetric {
  override def distance(a: Vector, b: Vector) = ... // your implementation for distance metric
}

object MyDistance {
  def apply() = new MyDistance()
}

val myMetric = MyDistance()
{% endhighlight %}
