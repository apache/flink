FlinkML is the Machine Learning (ML) library for Flink. It is a new effort in the Flink community,
with a growing list of algorithms and contributors. With FlinkML we aim to provide
scalable ML algorithms, an intuitive API, and tools that help minimize glue code in end-to-end ML
systems. You can see more details about our goals and where the library is headed in our [vision
and roadmap here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FlinkML%3A+Vision+and+Roadmap).

## Supported Algorithms

FlinkML currently supports the following algorithms:

### Supervised Learning

* [SVM using Communication efficient distributed dual coordinate ascent (CoCoA)](svm.html)
* [Multiple linear regression](multiple_linear_regression.html)
* [Optimization Framework](optimization.html)

### Unsupervised Learning

* [k-Nearest neighbors join](knn.html)

### Data Preprocessing

* [Polynomial Features](polynomial_features.html)
* [Standard Scaler](standard_scaler.html)
* [MinMax Scaler](min_max_scaler.html)

### Recommendation

* [Alternating Least Squares (ALS)](als.html)

### Utilities

* [Distance Metrics](distance_metrics.html)

## Getting Started

You can check out our [quickstart guide](quickstart.html) for a comprehensive getting started
example.

If you want to jump right in, you have to [set up a Flink program]({{ site.baseurl }}/apis/batch/index.html#linking-with-flink).
Next, you have to add the FlinkML dependency to the `pom.xml` of your project.

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-ml{{ site.scala_version_suffix }}</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.version }}</version>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Note that FlinkML is currently not part of the binary distribution.
See linking with it for cluster execution [here]({{site.baseurl}}/apis/cluster_execution.html#linking-with-modules-not-contained-in-the-binary-distribution).

Now you can start solving your analysis task.
The following code snippet shows how easy it is to train a multiple linear regression model.

{% highlight scala %}
// LabeledVector is a feature vector with a label (class or real value)
val trainingData: DataSet[LabeledVector] = ...
val testingData: DataSet[Vector] = ...

val mlr = MultipleLinearRegression()
  .setStepsize(1.0)
  .setIterations(100)
  .setConvergenceThreshold(0.001)

mlr.fit(trainingData)

// The fitted model can now be used to make predictions
val predictions: DataSet[LabeledVector] = mlr.predict(testingData)
{% endhighlight %}

## Pipelines

A key concept of FlinkML is its [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) inspired pipelining mechanism.
It allows you to quickly build complex data analysis pipelines how they appear in every data scientist's daily work.
An in-depth description of FlinkML's pipelines and their internal workings can be found [here](pipelines.html).

The following example code shows how easy it is to set up an analysis pipeline with FlinkML.

{% highlight scala %}
val trainingData: DataSet[LabeledVector] = ...
val testingData: DataSet[Vector] = ...

val scaler = StandardScaler()
val polyFeatures = PolynomialFeatures().setDegree(3)
val mlr = MultipleLinearRegression()

// Construct pipeline of standard scaler, polynomial features and multiple linear regression
val pipeline = scaler.chainTransformer(polyFeatures).chainPredictor(mlr)

// Train pipeline
pipeline.fit(trainingData)

// Calculate predictions
val predictions: DataSet[LabeledVector] = pipeline.predict(testingData)
{% endhighlight %}

One can chain a `Transformer` to another `Transformer` or a set of chained `Transformers` by calling the method `chainTransformer`.
If one wants to chain a `Predictor` to a `Transformer` or a set of chained `Transformers`, one has to call the method `chainPredictor`.
