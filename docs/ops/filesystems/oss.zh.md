## OSS: Object Storage Service

[Aliyun Object Storage Service](https://www.aliyun.com/product/oss) (Aliyun OSS) is widely used, particularly popular among China’s cloud users, and it provides cloud object storage for a variety of use cases.
You can use OSS with Flink for **reading** and **writing data** as well in conjunction with the [streaming **state backends**]({{ site.baseurl }}/ops/state/state_backends.html)

* This will be replaced by the TOC
{:toc}

You can use OSS objects like regular files by specifying paths in the following format:

{% highlight plain %}
oss://<your-bucket>/<object-name>
{% endhighlight %}

Below shows how to use OSS in a Flink job:

{% highlight java %}
// Read from OSS bucket
env.readTextFile("oss://<your-bucket>/<object-name>");

// Write to OSS bucket
stream.writeAsText("oss://<your-bucket>/<object-name>")

// Use OSS as FsStatebackend
env.setStateBackend(new FsStateBackend("oss://<your-bucket>/<object-name>"));
{% endhighlight %}

### Shaded Hadoop OSS file system

To use `flink-oss-fs-hadoop,` copy the respective JAR file from the `opt` directory to a directory in `plugins` directory of your Flink distribution before starting Flink, e.g.

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ./plugins/oss-fs-hadoop
cp ./opt/flink-oss-fs-hadoop-{{ site.version }}.jar ./plugins/oss-fs-hadoop/
{% endhighlight %}

`flink-oss-fs-hadoop` registers default FileSystem wrappers for URIs with the *oss://* scheme.

#### Configurations setup

After setting up the OSS FileSystem wrapper, you need to add some configurations to make sure that Flink is allowed to access your OSS buckets.

To allow for easy adoption, you can use the same configuration keys in `flink-conf.yaml` as in Hadoop's `core-site.xml`

You can see the configuration keys in the [Hadoop OSS documentation](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aliyun/tools/hadoop-aliyun/index.html).

There are some required configurations that must be added to `flink-conf.yaml` (**Other configurations defined in Hadoop OSS documentation are advanced configurations which used by performance tuning**):

{% highlight yaml %}
fs.oss.endpoint: Aliyun OSS endpoint to connect to
fs.oss.accessKeyId: Aliyun access key ID
fs.oss.accessKeySecret: Aliyun access key secret
{% endhighlight %}

{% top %}
