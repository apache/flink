## Overview

Checkpoints make state in Flink fault tolerant by allowing state and the
corresponding stream positions to be recovered, thereby giving the application
the same semantics as a failure-free execution.

See [Checkpointing]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/stream/state/checkpointing.html) for how to enable and
configure checkpoints for your program.

## Retained Checkpoints

Checkpoints are by default not retained and are only used to resume a
job from failures. They are deleted when a program is cancelled.
You can, however, configure periodic checkpoints to be retained.
Depending on the configuration these *retained* checkpoints are *not*
automatically cleaned up when the job fails or is canceled.
This way, you will have a checkpoint around to resume from if your job fails.

{% highlight java %}
CheckpointConfig config = env.getCheckpointConfig();
config.enableExternalizedCheckpoints(ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup.RETAIN_ON_CANCELLATION);
{% endhighlight %}

The `ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup` mode configures what happens with checkpoints when you cancel the job:

- **`ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup.RETAIN_ON_CANCELLATION`**: Retain the checkpoint when the job is cancelled. Note that you have to manually clean up the checkpoint state after cancellation in this case.

- **`ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup.DELETE_ON_CANCELLATION`**: Delete the checkpoint when the job is cancelled. The checkpoint state will only be available if the job fails.

### Directory Structure

Similarly to [savepoints](savepoints.html), a checkpoint consists
of a meta data file and, depending on the state backend, some additional data
files. The meta data file and data files are stored in the directory that is
configured via `state.checkpoints.dir` in the configuration files, 
and also can be specified for per job in the code.

The current checkpoint directory layout ([introduced by FLINK-8531](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-8531)) is as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
/user-defined-checkpoint-dir
    |
    + --shared/
    + --taskowned/
    + --chk-00001/
    + --chk-00002/
    + --chk-00003/
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

The **SHARED** directory is for state that is possibly part of multiple checkpoints, **TASKOWNED** is for state that must never by dropped by the JobManager, and **EXCLUSIVE** is for state that belongs to one checkpoint only. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Attention:</strong> The checkpoint directory is not part of a public API and can be changed in the future release.
</div>
#### Configure globally via configuration files

{% highlight yaml %}
state.checkpoints.dir: hdfs:///checkpoints/
{% endhighlight %}

#### Configure for per job when constructing the state backend

{% highlight java %}
env.setStateBackend(new RocksDBStateBackend("hdfs:///checkpoints-data/"));
{% endhighlight %}

### Difference to Savepoints

Checkpoints have a few differences from [savepoints](savepoints.html). They
- use a state backend specific (low-level) data format, may be incremental.
- do not support Flink specific features like rescaling.

### Resuming from a retained checkpoint

A job may be resumed from a checkpoint just as from a savepoint
by using the checkpoint's meta data file instead (see the
[savepoint restore guide](../cli.html#restore-a-savepoint)). Note that if the
meta data file is not self-contained, the jobmanager needs to have access to
the data files it refers to (see [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)
above).

{% highlight shell %}
$ bin/flink run -s :checkpointMetaDataPath [:runArgs]
{% endhighlight %}

{% top %}
