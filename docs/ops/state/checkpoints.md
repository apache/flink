## Overview

Checkpoints make state in Flink fault tolerant by allowing state and the
corresponding stream positions to be recovered, thereby giving the application
the same semantics as a failure-free execution.

See [Checkpointing]({% link dev/stream/state/checkpointing.md %}) for how to enable and
configure checkpoints for your program.

## Retained Checkpoints

Checkpoints are by default not retained and are only used to resume a
job from failures. They are deleted when a program is cancelled.
You can, however, configure periodic checkpoints to be retained.
Depending on the configuration these *retained* checkpoints are *not*
automatically cleaned up when the job fails or is canceled.
This way, you will have a checkpoint around to resume from if your job fails.

{% highlight java %}
CheckpointConfig config = env.getCheckpointConfig();
config.enableExternalizedCheckpoints(ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup.RETAIN_ON_CANCELLATION);
{% endhighlight %}

The `ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup` mode configures what happens with checkpoints when you cancel the job:

- **`ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup.RETAIN_ON_CANCELLATION`**: Retain the checkpoint when the job is cancelled. Note that you have to manually clean up the checkpoint state after cancellation in this case.

- **`ExternalizedCheckpointCleanup.DELETE_ON_CANCELLATION`**: Delete the checkpoint when the job is cancelled. The checkpoint state will only be available if the job fails.

### Directory Structure

Similarly to [savepoints]({% link ops/state/savepoints.md %}), a checkpoint consists
of a meta data file and, depending on the state backend, some additional data
files. The meta data file and data files are stored in the directory that is
configured via `state.checkpoints.dir` in the configuration files, 
and also can be specified for per job in the code.

The current checkpoint directory layout ([introduced by FLINK-8531](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-8531)) is as follows:

{% highlight yaml %}
/user-defined-checkpoint-dir
    /{job-id}
        |
        + --shared/
        + --taskowned/
        + --chk-1/
        + --chk-2/
        + --chk-3/
        ...
{% endhighlight %}

The **SHARED** directory is for state that is possibly part of multiple checkpoints, **TASKOWNED** is for state that must never be dropped by the JobManager, and **EXCLUSIVE** is for state that belongs to one checkpoint only. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Attention:</strong> The checkpoint directory is not part of a public API and can be changed in the future release.
</div>
#### Configure globally via configuration files

{% highlight yaml %}
state.checkpoints.dir: hdfs:///checkpoints/
{% endhighlight %}

#### Configure for per job when constructing the state backend

{% highlight java %}
env.setStateBackend(new RocksDBStateBackend("hdfs:///checkpoints-data/"));
{% endhighlight %}

### Difference to Savepoints

Checkpoints have a few differences from [savepoints]({% link ops/state/savepoints.md %}). They
- use a state backend specific (low-level) data format, may be incremental.
- do not support Flink specific features like rescaling.

### Resuming from a retained checkpoint

A job may be resumed from a checkpoint just as from a savepoint
by using the checkpoint's meta data file instead (see the
[savepoint restore guide]({% link deployment/cli.md %}#restore-a-savepoint)). Note that if the
meta data file is not self-contained, the jobmanager needs to have access to
the data files it refers to (see [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)
above).

{% highlight shell %}
$ bin/flink run -s :checkpointMetaDataPath [:runArgs]
{% endhighlight %}

### Unaligned checkpoints

Starting with Flink 1.11, checkpoints can be unaligned. 
[Unaligned checkpoints]({% link concepts/stateful-stream-processing.md
%}#unaligned-checkpointing) contain in-flight data (i.e., data stored in
buffers) as part of the checkpoint state, which allows checkpoint barriers to
overtake these buffers. Thus, the checkpoint duration becomes independent of the
current throughput as checkpoint barriers are effectively not embedded into 
the stream of data anymore.

You should use unaligned checkpoints if your checkpointing durations are very
high due to backpressure. Then, checkpointing time becomes mostly
independent of the end-to-end latency. Be aware unaligned checkpointing
adds to I/O to the state backends, so you shouldn't use it when the I/O to
the state backend is actually the bottleneck during checkpointing.

Note that unaligned checkpoints is a brand-new feature that currently has the
following limitations:

- You cannot rescale or change job graph with from unaligned checkpoints. You 
  have to take a savepoint before rescaling. Savepoints are always aligned 
  independent of the alignment setting of checkpoints.
- Flink currently does not support concurrent unaligned checkpoints. However, 
  due to the more predictable and shorter checkpointing times, concurrent 
  checkpoints might not be needed at all. However, savepoints can also not 
  happen concurrently to unaligned checkpoints, so they will take slightly 
  longer.
- Unaligned checkpoints break with an implicit guarantee in respect to 
  watermarks during recovery:

Currently, Flink generates the watermark as a first step of recovery instead of 
storing the latest watermark in the operators to ease rescaling. In unaligned 
checkpoints, that means on recovery, **Flink generates watermarks after it 
restores in-flight data**. If your pipeline uses an **operator that applies the
latest watermark on each record**, it will produce **different results** than 
for aligned checkpoints. If your operator depends on the latest watermark being
always available, then the workaround is to store the watermark in the operator 
state. To support rescaling, watermarks should be stored per key-group in a 
union-state. We most likely will implement this approach as a general solution 
(didn't make it into Flink 1.11.0).

In the upcoming release(s), Flink will address these limitations and will
provide a fine-grained way to trigger unaligned checkpoints only for the 
in-flight data that moves slowly with timeout mechanism. These options will
decrease the pressure on I/O in the state backends and eventually allow
unaligned checkpoints to become the default checkpointing. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Attention:</strong>Unaligned checkpoints may produce corrupted checkpoints in 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 and we discourage use in production settings.
