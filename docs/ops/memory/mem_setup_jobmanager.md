The JobManager is the controlling element of the Flink Cluster. 
It consists of three distinct components: Resource Manager, Dispatcher and one JobMaster per running Flink Job.
This guide walks you through high level and fine-grained memory configurations for the JobManager.

{:toc}

The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version *1.11*. If you upgrade Flink
from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](mem_migration.html) because many changes were introduced with the *1.11* release.

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> This memory setup guide is relevant <strong>only for the JobManager</strong>!
The JobManager memory components have a similar but simpler structure compared to the [TaskManagers' memory configuration](mem_setup_tm.html).

## Configure Total Memory

The simplest way to set up the memory configuration is to configure the [total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) for the process.
If you run the JobManager process using local [execution mode](#local-execution) you do not need to configure memory options, they will have no effect.

## Detailed configuration

### Configure JVM Heap

As mentioned before in the [total memory description](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory), another way to set up the memory
for the JobManager is to specify explicitly the *JVM Heap* size ([`jobmanager.memory.heap.size`](../config.html#jobmanager-memory-heap-size)).
It gives more control over the available *JVM Heap* which is used by:

* Flink framework
* User code executed during job submission (e.g. for certain batch sources) or in checkpoint completion callbacks

The required size of *JVM Heap* is mostly driven by the number of running jobs, their structure, and requirements for
the mentioned user code.

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> If you have configured the *JVM Heap* explicitly, it is recommended to set
neither *total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.
The Flink scripts and CLI set the *JVM Heap* size via the JVM parameters *-Xms* and *-Xmx* when they start the JobManager process, see also [JVM parameters](mem_setup.html#jvm-parameters).

### Configure Off-heap Memory

The *Off-heap* memory component accounts for any type of *JVM direct memory* and *native memory* usage. Therefore,
you can also enable the *JVM Direct Memory* limit by setting the [`jobmanager.memory.enable-jvm-direct-memory-limit`](../config.html#jobmanager-memory-enable-jvm-direct-memory-limit) option.
If this option is configured, Flink will set the limit to the *Off-heap* memory size via the corresponding JVM argument: *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*.
See also [JVM parameters](mem_setup.html#jvm-parameters).

The size of this component can be configured by [`jobmanager.memory.off-heap.size`](../config.html#jobmanager-memory-off-heap-size)
option. This option can be tuned e.g. if the JobManager process throws ‘OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory’, see
[the troubleshooting guide](mem_trouble.html#outofmemoryerror-direct-buffer-memory) for more information.

There can be the following possible sources of *Off-heap* memory consumption:

* Flink framework dependencies (e.g. Akka network communication)
* User code executed during job submission (e.g. for certain batch sources) or in checkpoint completion callbacks

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> If you have configured the [Total Flink Memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory)
and the [JVM Heap](#configure-jvm-heap) explicitly but you have not configured the *Off-heap* memory, the size of the *Off-heap* memory
will be derived as the [Total Flink Memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) minus the [JVM Heap](#configure-jvm-heap).
The default value of the *Off-heap* memory option will be ignored.

## Local Execution

If you run Flink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then the JobManager memory configuration options are ignored.
