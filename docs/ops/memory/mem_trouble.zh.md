## IllegalConfigurationException

If you see an *IllegalConfigurationException* thrown from *TaskExecutorProcessUtils*, it usually indicates
that there is either an invalid configuration value (e.g. negative memory size, fraction that is greater than 1, etc.)
or configuration conflicts. Check the documentation chapters related to the [memory components](mem_detail.html)
mentioned in the exception message.

## OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

The exception usually indicates that the JVM heap is too small. You can try to increase the JVM heap size
by increasing [total memory](mem_setup.html#配置总内存) or [task heap memory](mem_setup.html#任务算子堆内存).

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> You can also increase the [framework heap memory](mem_detail.html#框架内存) but this option
is advanced and should only be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework itself needs more memory.

## OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory

The exception usually indicates that the JVM *direct memory* limit is too small or that there is a *direct memory leak*.
Check whether user code or other external dependencies use the JVM *direct memory* and that it is properly accounted for.
You can try to increase its limit by adjusting [direct off-heap memory](mem_detail.html).
See also [how to configure off-heap memory](mem_setup.html#配置堆外内存直接内存或本地内存)) and
the [JVM arguments](mem_detail.html#jvm-参数) which Flink sets.

## OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace

The exception usually indicates that [JVM metaspace limit](mem_detail.html#jvm-参数) is configured too small.
You can try to increase the [JVM metaspace option](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-jvm-metaspace-size).

## IOException: Insufficient number of network buffers

The exception usually indicates that the size of the configured [network memory](mem_detail.html)
is not big enough. You can try to increase the *network memory* by adjusting the following options:
* [`taskmanager.memory.network.min`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min)
* [`taskmanager.memory.network.max`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max)
* [`taskmanager.memory.network.fraction`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-fraction)

## Container Memory Exceeded

If a task executor container tries to allocate memory beyond its requested size (Yarn, Mesos or Kubernetes),
this usually indicates that Flink has not reserved enough native memory. You can observe this either by using an external
monitoring system or from the error messages when a container gets killed by the deployment environment.

If [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend) is used and the memory controlling is disabled,
you can try to increase the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#托管内存).

Alternatively, you can increase the [JVM overhead](mem_detail.html).
See also [how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#容器container的内存配置).
