When deciding how and where to run Flink, there's a wide range of options available.

* This will be replaced by the TOC
{:toc}

## Deployment Modes

Flink can execute applications in one of three ways:
 - in Session Mode, 
 - in a Per-Job Mode, or
 - in Application Mode.

 The above modes differ in:
 - the cluster lifecycle and resource isolation guarantees
 - whether the application's `main()` method is executed on the client or on the cluster.

#### Session Mode

*Session mode* assumes an already running cluster and uses the resources of that cluster to execute any 
submitted application. Applications executed in the same (session) cluster use, and consequently compete
for, the same resources. This has the advantage that you do not pay the resource overhead of spinning up
a full cluster for every submitted job. But, if one of the jobs misbehaves or brings down a Task Manager,
then all jobs running on that Task Manager will be affected by the failure. This, apart from a negative
impact on the job that caused the failure, implies a potential massive recovery process with all the 
restarting jobs accessing the filesystem concurrently and making it unavailable to other services. 
Additionally, having a single cluster running multiple jobs implies more load for the Flink Master, who 
is responsible for the book-keeping of all the jobs in the cluster.

#### Per-Job Mode

Aiming at providing better resource isolation guarantees, the *Per-Job* mode uses the available cluster manager
framework (e.g. YARN, Kubernetes) to spin up a cluster for each submitted job. This cluster is available to 
that job only. When the job finishes, the cluster is torn down and any lingering resources (files, etc) are
cleared up. This provides better resource isolation, as a misbehaving job can only bring down its own 
Task Managers. In addition, it spreads the load of book-keeping across multiple Flink Masters, as there is 
one per job. For these reasons, the *Per-Job* resource allocation model is the preferred mode by many 
production reasons.

#### Application Mode
    
In all the above modes, the application's `main()` method is executed on the client side. This process 
includes downloading the application's dependencies locally, executing the `main()` to extract a representation
of the application that Flink's runtime can understand (i.e. the `JobGraph`) and ship the dependencies and
the `JobGraph(s)` to the cluster. This makes the Client a heavy resource consumer as it may need substantial
network bandwidth to download dependencies and ship binaries to the cluster, and CPU cycles to execute the
`main()`. This problem can be more pronounced when the Client is shared across users.

Building on this observation, the *Application Mode* creates a cluster per submitted application, but this time,
the `main()` method of the application is executed on the Flink Master. Creating a cluster per application can be 
seen as creating a session cluster shared only among the jobs of a particular application, and torn down when
the application finishes. With this architecture, the *Application Mode* provides the same resource isolation
and load balancing guarantees as the *Per-Job* mode, but at the granularity of a whole application. Executing 
the `main()` on the Flink Master allows for saving the CPU cycles required, but also save the bandwidth required
for downloading the dependencies locally. Furthermore, it allows for more even spread of the network load of
downloading the dependencies of the applications in the cluster, as there is one Flink Master per application.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="span">
  <strong>Note:</strong> In the Application Mode, the `main()` is executed on the cluster and not on the client, 
  as in the other modes. This may have implications for your code as, for example, any paths you register in 
  your environment using the `registerCachedFile()` must be accessible by the Flink Master of your application.
</div>

Compared to the *Per-Job* mode, the *Application Mode* allows the submission of applications consisting of
multiple jobs. The order of job execution is not affected by the deployment mode but by the call used
to launch the job. Using `execute()`, which is blocking, establishes an order and it will lead to the 
execution of the "next"  job being postponed until "this" job finishes. Using `executeAsync()`, which is 
non-blocking, will lead to the "next" job starting before "this" job finishes.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="span">
  <strong>Attention:</strong> The Application Mode allows for multi-`execute()` applications but 
  High-Availability is not supported in these cases. High-Availability in Application Mode is only
  supported for single-`execute()` applications.
</div>

#### Summary

In *Session Mode*, the cluster lifecycle is independent of that of any job running on the cluster
and the resources are shared across all jobs. The *Per-Job* mode pays the price of spinning up a cluster
for every submitted job, but this comes with better isolation guarantees as the resources are not shared 
across jobs. In this case, the lifecycle of the cluster is bound to that of the job. Finally, the 
*Application Mode* creates a session cluster per application and executes the application's `main()` 
method on the cluster.
