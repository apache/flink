# Google Cloud Storage

[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) (GCS) provides cloud storage for a variety of use cases. You can use it for **reading** and **writing** data, and for checkpoint storage when using [`FileSystemCheckpointStorage`]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/checkpoints" >}}#the-filesystemcheckpointstorage)) with the [streaming **state backends**]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/state_backends" >}}).

You can use GCS objects like regular files by specifying paths in the following format:

```plain
gs://<your-bucket>/<endpoint>
```

The endpoint can either be a single file or a directory, for example:

```java
// Read from GCS bucket
env.readTextFile("gs://<bucket>/<endpoint>");

// Write to GCS bucket
stream.writeAsText("gs://<bucket>/<endpoint>");

// Use GCS as checkpoint storage
env.getCheckpointConfig().setCheckpointStorage("gs://<bucket>/<endpoint>");

```

Note that these examples are *not* exhaustive and you can use GCS in other places as well, including your [high availability setup]({{< ref "docs/deployment/ha/overview" >}}) or the [EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/state_backends" >}}#the-rocksdbstatebackend); everywhere that Flink expects a FileSystem URI.

### GCS File System plugin

Flink provides the `flink-gs-fs-hadoop` file system to write to GCS.
This implementation is self-contained with no dependency footprint, so there is no need to add Hadoop to the classpath to use it.

`flink-gs-fs-hadoop` registers a `FileSystem` wrapper for URIs with the *gs://* scheme. It uses Google's [gcs-connector](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.cloud.bigdataoss/gcs-connector/hadoop3-2.2.15) Hadoop library to access GCS. It also uses Google's [google-cloud-storage](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.cloud/google-cloud-storage/2.15.0) library to provide `RecoverableWriter` support.

This file system can be used with the [FileSystem connector]({{< ref "docs/connectors/datastream/filesystem.md" >}}).

To use `flink-gs-fs-hadoop`, copy the JAR file from the `opt` directory to the `plugins` directory of your Flink distribution before starting Flink, i.e.

```bash
mkdir ./plugins/gs-fs-hadoop
cp ./opt/flink-gs-fs-hadoop-{{< version >}}.jar ./plugins/gs-fs-hadoop/
```

### Configuration

The underlying Hadoop file system can be configured using the [Hadoop configuration keys](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.15/gcs/CONFIGURATION.md) for `gcs-connector` by adding the configurations to your `flink-conf.yaml`.

For example, `gcs-connector` has a `fs.gs.http.connect-timeout` configuration key. If you want to change it, you need to set `gs.http.connect-timeout: xyz` in `flink-conf.yaml`. Flink will internally translate this back to `fs.gs.http.connect-timeout`. 

You can also set `gcs-connector` options directly in the Hadoop `core-site.xml` configuration file, so long as the Hadoop configuration directory is made known to Flink via the `env.hadoop.conf.dir` Flink option or via the `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` environment variable.

`flink-gs-fs-hadoop` can also be configured by setting the following options in `flink-conf.yaml`:

| Key                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| gs.writer.temporary.bucket.name           | Set this property to choose a bucket to hold temporary blobs for in-progress writes via `RecoverableWriter`. If this property is not set, temporary blobs will be written to same bucket as the final file being written. In either case, temporary blobs are written with the prefix `.inprogress/`. <br><br>  It is recommended to choose a separate bucket in order to [assign it a TTL](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle), to provide a mechanism to clean up orphaned blobs that can occur when restoring from check/savepoints.<br><br>If you do use a separate bucket with a TTL for temporary blobs, attempts to restart jobs from check/savepoints after the TTL interval expires may fail. 
| gs.writer.chunk.size                      | Set this property to [set the chunk size](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-core/latest/com.google.cloud.WriteChannel#com_google_cloud_WriteChannel_setChunkSize_int_) for writes via `RecoverableWriter`. <br><br>If not set, a Google-determined default chunk size will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Authentication to access GCS

Most operations on GCS require authentication. To provide authentication credentials, either:

* Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON credentials file, as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#setting_the_environment_variable), where JobManagers and TaskManagers run. This is the **recommended** method.


* Set the `google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile` property in `core-site.xml` to the path to the JSON credentials file (and make sure that the Hadoop configuration directory is specified to Flink as described [above](#configuration)):
  
```
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile</name>
    <value>PATH TO GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION JSON FILE</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

For `flink-gs-fs-hadoop` to use credentials via either of these two methods, the use of service accounts for authentication must be enabled. This is enabled by default; however, it can be disabled in `core-site.xml` by setting:

```
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable</name>
    <value>false</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

{{< hint warning >}}
`gcs-connector` supports additional options to provide authentication credentials besides the `google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile` option described above. 

However, if you use any of those other options, the provided credentials will not be used by the `google-cloud-storage` library, which provides `RecoverableWriter` support, so Flink recoverable-write operations would be expected to fail.

For this reason, use of the `gcs-connector` authentication-credentials options other than `google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile` is **not recommended.**
