# Amazon S3

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) provides cloud object storage for a variety of use cases. You can use S3 with Flink for **reading** and **writing data** as well in conjunction with the [streaming **state backends**]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/state_backends" >}}).

You can use S3 objects like regular files by specifying paths in the following format:

```plain
s3://<your-bucket>/<endpoint>
```

The endpoint can either be a single file or a directory, for example:

```java
// Read from S3 bucket
env.readTextFile("s3://<bucket>/<endpoint>");

// Write to S3 bucket
stream.writeAsText("s3://<bucket>/<endpoint>");

// Use S3 as checkpoint storage
env.getCheckpointConfig().setCheckpointStorage("s3://<your-bucket>/<endpoint>");
```

Note that these examples are *not* exhaustive and you can use S3 in other places as well, including your [high availability setup]({{< ref "docs/deployment/ha/overview" >}}) or the [EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/state_backends" >}}#the-rocksdbstatebackend); everywhere that Flink expects a FileSystem URI.

For most use cases, you may use one of our `flink-s3-fs-hadoop` and `flink-s3-fs-presto` S3 filesystem plugins which are self-contained and easy to set up.
For some cases, however, e.g., for using S3 as YARN's resource storage dir, it may be necessary to set up a specific Hadoop S3 filesystem implementation.

### Hadoop/Presto S3 File Systems plugins

{{< hint info >}}
You don't have to configure this manually if you are running [Flink on EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-flink.html).
{{< /hint >}}

Flink provides two file systems to talk to Amazon S3, `flink-s3-fs-presto` and `flink-s3-fs-hadoop`.
Both implementations are self-contained with no dependency footprint, so there is no need to add Hadoop to the classpath to use them.

  - `flink-s3-fs-presto`, registered under the scheme *s3://* and *s3p://*, is based on code from the [Presto project](https://prestodb.io/).
  You can configure it using [the same configuration keys as the Presto file system](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.187/connector/hive.html#amazon-s3-configuration), by adding the configurations to your `flink-conf.yaml`. The Presto S3 implementation is the recommended file system for checkpointing to S3.

  - `flink-s3-fs-hadoop`, registered under *s3://* and *s3a://*, based on code from the [Hadoop Project](https://hadoop.apache.org/).
  The file system can be [configured using Hadoop's s3a configuration keys](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html#S3A) by adding the configurations to your `flink-conf.yaml`. 
  
     For example, Hadoop has a `fs.s3a.connection.maximum` configuration key. If you want to change it, you need to put `s3.connection.maximum: xyz` to the `flink-conf.yaml`. Flink will internally translate this back to `fs.s3a.connection.maximum`. There is no need to pass configuration parameters using Hadoop's XML configuration files.
  
    It is the only S3 file system with support for the [StreamingFileSink]({{< ref "docs/connectors/datastream/streamfile_sink" >}}) and the [FileSink]({{< ref "docs/connectors/datastream/file_sink" >}}).
  

Both `flink-s3-fs-hadoop` and `flink-s3-fs-presto` register default FileSystem
wrappers for URIs with the *s3://* scheme, `flink-s3-fs-hadoop` also registers
for *s3a://* and `flink-s3-fs-presto` also registers for *s3p://*, so you can
use this to use both at the same time.
For example, the job uses the [StreamingFileSink]({{< ref "docs/connectors/datastream/streamfile_sink" >}}) which only supports Hadoop, but uses Presto for checkpointing.
In this case, it is advised to explicitly use *s3a://* as a scheme for the sink (Hadoop) and *s3p://* for checkpointing (Presto). The same holds for the 
[FileSink]({{< ref "docs/connectors/datastream/file_sink" >}}).

To use `flink-s3-fs-hadoop` or `flink-s3-fs-presto`, copy the respective JAR file from the `opt` directory to the `plugins` directory of your Flink distribution before starting Flink, e.g.

```bash
mkdir ./plugins/s3-fs-presto
cp ./opt/flink-s3-fs-presto-{{< version >}}.jar ./plugins/s3-fs-presto/
```

#### Configure Access Credentials

After setting up the S3 FileSystem wrapper, you need to make sure that Flink is allowed to access your S3 buckets.

##### Identity and Access Management (IAM) (Recommended)

The recommended way of setting up credentials on AWS is via [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html). You can use IAM features to securely give Flink instances the credentials that they need to access S3 buckets. Details about how to do this are beyond the scope of this documentation. Please refer to the AWS user guide. What you are looking for are [IAM Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html).

If you set this up correctly, you can manage access to S3 within AWS and don't need to distribute any access keys to Flink.

##### Access Keys (Discouraged)

Access to S3 can be granted via your **access and secret key pair**. Please note that this is discouraged since the [introduction of IAM roles](https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx1XG3FX6VMU6O5/A-safer-way-to-distribute-AWS-credentials-to-EC2).

You need to configure both `s3.access-key` and `s3.secret-key`  in Flink's  `flink-conf.yaml`:

```yaml
s3.access-key: your-access-key
s3.secret-key: your-secret-key
```

## Configure Non-S3 Endpoint

The S3 Filesystems also support using S3 compliant object stores such as [IBM's Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage) and [Minio](https://min.io/).
To do so, configure your endpoint in `flink-conf.yaml`.

```yaml
s3.endpoint: your-endpoint-hostname
```

## Configure Path Style Access

Some S3 compliant object stores might not have virtual host style addressing enabled by default. In such cases, you will have to provide the property to enable path style access in `flink-conf.yaml`.

```yaml
s3.path.style.access: true
```

## Entropy injection for S3 file systems

The bundled S3 file systems (`flink-s3-fs-presto` and `flink-s3-fs-hadoop`) support entropy injection. Entropy injection is
a technique to improve the scalability of AWS S3 buckets through adding some random characters near the beginning of the key.

If entropy injection is activated, a configured substring in the path is replaced with random characters. For example, path
`s3://my-bucket/_entropy_/checkpoints/dashboard-job/` would be replaced by something like `s3://my-bucket/gf36ikvg/checkpoints/dashboard-job/`.
**This only happens when the file creation passes the option to inject entropy!**
Otherwise, the file path removes the entropy key substring entirely. See [FileSystem.create(Path, WriteOption)](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/api/java/org/apache/flink/core/fs/FileSystem.html#create-org.apache.flink.core.fs.Path-org.apache.flink.core.fs.FileSystem.WriteOptions-)
for details.

{{< hint info >}}
The Flink runtime currently passes the option to inject entropy only to checkpoint data files. All other files, including checkpoint metadata and external URI, do not inject entropy to keep checkpoint URIs predictable.
{{< /hint >}}

To enable entropy injection, configure the *entropy key* and the *entropy length* parameters.

```
s3.entropy.key: _entropy_
s3.entropy.length: 4 (default)

```

The `s3.entropy.key` defines the string in paths that is replaced by the random characters. Paths that do not contain the entropy key are left unchanged.
If a file system operation does not pass the *"inject entropy"* write option, the entropy key substring is simply removed.
The `s3.entropy.length` defines the number of random alphanumeric characters used for entropy.
