# Azure Blob Storage

[Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/) is a Microsoft-managed service providing cloud storage for a variety of use cases.
You can use Azure Blob Storage with Flink for **reading** and **writing data** as well in conjunction with the [streaming **state backends**]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/state_backends" >}})  

Flink supports accessing Azure Blob Storage using both [wasb://](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/index.html) or [abfs://](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/abfs.html).

{{< hint info >}} 
Azure recommends using abfs:// for accessing ADLS Gen2 storage accounts even though wasb:// works through backward compatibility.  
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
abfs:// can be used for accessing the ADLS Gen2 storage accounts only. Please visit Azure documentation on how to identify ADLS Gen2 storage account.  
{{< /hint >}}


You can use Azure Blob Storage objects like regular files by specifying paths in the following format:

```plain
// WASB unencrypted access
wasb://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<object-path>

// WASB SSL encrypted access
wasbs://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<object-path>

// ABFS unecrypted access
abfs://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<object-path>

// ABFS SSL encrypted access
abfss://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.dfs.core.windows.net/<object-path>
```

See below for how to use Azure Blob Storage in a Flink job:

```java
// Read from Azure Blob storage
env.readTextFile("wasb://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<object-path>");

// Write to Azure Blob storage
stream.writeAsText("wasb://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<object-path>");

// Use Azure Blob Storage as checkpoint storage
env.getCheckpointConfig().setCheckpointStorage("wasb://<your-container>@$<your-azure-account>.blob.core.windows.net/<object-path>");
```

### Shaded Hadoop Azure Blob Storage file system

To use `flink-azure-fs-hadoop`, copy the respective JAR file from the `opt` directory to the `plugins` directory of your Flink distribution before starting Flink, e.g.

```bash
mkdir ./plugins/azure-fs-hadoop
cp ./opt/flink-azure-fs-hadoop-{{< version >}}.jar ./plugins/azure-fs-hadoop/
```

`flink-azure-fs-hadoop` registers default FileSystem wrappers for URIs with the *wasb://* and *wasbs://* (SSL encrypted access) scheme.

## Credentials Configuration

### WASB

Hadoop's WASB Azure Filesystem supports configuration of credentials via the Hadoop configuration as 
outlined in the [Hadoop Azure Blob Storage documentation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-azure/index.html#Configuring_Credentials).
For convenience Flink forwards all Flink configurations with a key prefix of `fs.azure` to the 
Hadoop configuration of the filesystem. Consequently, the azure blob storage key can be configured 
in `flink-conf.yaml` via:

```yaml
fs.azure.account.key.<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net: <azure_storage_key>
```

Alternatively, the filesystem can be configured to read the Azure Blob Storage key from an 
environment variable `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` by setting the following configuration keys in 
`flink-conf.yaml`.  

```yaml
fs.azure.account.keyprovider.<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net: org.apache.flink.fs.azurefs.EnvironmentVariableKeyProvider
```

### ABFS

Hadoop's ABFS Azure Filesystem supports several ways of configuring authentication. Please visit the [Hadoop ABFS documentation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/abfs.html#Authentication) documentation on how to configure.

{{< hint info >}}
Azure recommends using Azure managed identity to access the ADLS Gen2 storage accounts using abfs. Please refer to [Azure managed identities documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) for more details.

Please visit the [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities#azure-services-that-support-managed-identities-for-azure-resources) for the list of services that support Managed Identities. Flink clusters deployed in those Azure services can take advantage of Managed Identities.
{{< /hint >}}

##### Accessing ABFS using storage Keys (Discouraged)
Azure blob storage key can be configured in `flink-conf.yaml` via:

```yaml
fs.azure.account.key.<account_name>.dfs.core.windows.net: <azure_storage_key>
```
