# Security Overview

Frameworks that process data are sensitive components; you must use authentication and encryption to 
secure your data and data sources. Apache Flink supports authentication with [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) 
and can be configured to encrypt all network communication with [SSL/TLS](https://www.ssl.com/faqs/faq-what-is-ssl/).

{{< hint info >}}
SSL and TLS are both encryption protocols for the transport layer, used for encrypting data between
the client and server. The TLS protocol is the successor to SSL. Flink enforces TLS by default, but 
you can also switch back to SSL.
{{< /hint >}}

When we talk about security for Flink, we generally make a distinction between securing the internal 
communication within the Flink cluster (i.e. between the Taskmanagers, between the Taskmanagers and 
the Jobmanager) and securing the external communication between the cluster and the outside world.

Internally, [Netty](https://netty.io) is used for the TCP connections used for data exchange among 
the Taskmanagers, and Akka is used for RPC between the Jobmanager and the Taskmanagers.

Externally, HTTP is used for pretty much everything, except that some external services used as sources 
or sinks may use some other network protocol.

## What is supported?

Security enhancement features by the Flink community make it easy to access secured data, protect 
associated credentials, and increase overall security in a Flink cluster. The following security 
measures are currently supported:

- Authentication of connections between Flink processes 
- Encryption of data transferred between Flink processes using SSL (Note that there is a performance 
  degradation when SSL is enabled, the magnitude of which depends on the CPU type, the JVM implementation, 
  and the key size.)
- Authorization of read / write operations by clients 
- Authorization is pluggable and integration with external authorization services is supported

It is worth noting that security needs to be manually configured because the overall philosophy in 
Flink is to have defaults that work out-of-the-box, without any configuration. Thus, non-secured 
clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and unencrypted 
clients. 

## How to use this section 

The guides in this section explain how to configure and use these security features. 

We are going to look at the following topics:

- Using SSL to secure internal communication
- Using SSL to secure external communication
- Using Kerberos for authentication

Weâ€™ll describe the new features, including Kerberos-based access to HDFS and Kafka, transport security (TLS), 
and service-level authorization which protects your Flink cluster from unauthorized access.
