# Kubernetes HA Services

Flink's Kubernetes HA services use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for high availability services.

Kubernetes high availability services can only be used when deploying to Kubernetes.
Consequently, they can be configured when using [standalone Flink on Kubernetes]({{< ref "docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/kubernetes" >}}) or the [native Kubernetes integration]({{< ref "docs/deployment/resource-providers/native_kubernetes" >}})

## Prerequisites

In order to use Flink's Kubernetes HA services you must fulfill the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes >= 1.9.
- Service account with permissions to create, edit, delete and watch ConfigMaps. 
  Take a look at how to configure a service account for [Flink's native Kubernetes integration]({{< ref "docs/deployment/resource-providers/native_kubernetes" >}}#rbac) and [standalone Flink on Kubernetes]({{< ref "docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/kubernetes" >}}#kubernetes-high-availability-services) for more information. 

### RBAC example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  labels:
    app: flink
  name: flink-service-account
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  labels:
    app: flink
  name: flink-role-binding-flink
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - configmaps
  verbs:
  - get
  - create
  - delete
  - update
  - list
  - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  labels:
    app: flink
  name: flink-role-binding-default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: flink-role-binding-flink
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: flink-service-account
```

## Configuration

In order to start an HA-cluster you have to configure the following configuration keys:

- [high-availability]({{< ref "docs/deployment/config" >}}#high-availability-1) (required): 
The `high-availability.type` option has to be set to `KubernetesHaServicesFactory`.

```yaml
high-availability.type: kubernetes
```

- [high-availability.storageDir]({{< ref "docs/deployment/config" >}}#high-availability-storagedir) (required): 
JobManager metadata is persisted in the file system `high-availability.storageDir` and only a pointer to this state is stored in Kubernetes.

```yaml
high-availability.storageDir: s3://flink/recovery
```

The `storageDir` stores all metadata needed to recover a JobManager failure.
  
- [kubernetes.cluster-id]({{< ref "docs/deployment/config" >}}#kubernetes-cluster-id) (required):
In order to identify the Flink cluster, you have to specify a `kubernetes.cluster-id`.

<span class="label label-info">The `kubernetes.cluster-id` is used as prefix for autogenerated configmaps, so only alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.' are allowed and must start with an alphanumeric character</span>

```yaml
kubernetes.cluster-id: cluster1337
```

- [kubernetes.namespace]({{< ref "docs/deployment/config" >}}#kubernetes-namespace) (optional):
Flink will create the configmaps in this configured namespace. Default namespace is "default". If another namespace is wished, this value has to be changed, and also the RBAC for the service account needs to be adjusted accordingly.
```yaml
kubernetes.namespace: flink 
```

### Example configuration

Configure high availability mode in `conf/flink-conf.yaml`:

```yaml
kubernetes.cluster-id: <cluster-id>
high-availability.type: kubernetes
high-availability.storageDir: hdfs:///flink/recovery
```

{{< top >}}

## High availability data clean up

To keep HA data while restarting the Flink cluster, simply delete the deployment (via `kubectl delete deployment <cluster-id>`). 
All the Flink cluster related resources will be deleted (e.g. JobManager Deployment, TaskManager pods, services, Flink conf ConfigMap). 
HA related ConfigMaps will be retained because they do not set the owner reference. 
When restarting the cluster, all previously running jobs will be recovered and restarted from the latest successful checkpoint.
