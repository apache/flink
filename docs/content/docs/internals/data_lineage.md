# Native Lineage Support
Data lineage has gain more and more criticality in data ecosystem. As Apache Flink is widely used for data ingestion and ETL in Streaming Data Lake, we need 
an end to end lineage solution for scenarios including but not limited to:
  - `Data Quality Assurance`: Identifying and rectifying data inconsistencies by tracing data errors back to their origin within the data pipeline.
  - `Data Governance`ï¼š Establishing clear data ownership and accountability by documenting data origins and transformations.
  - `Regulatory Compliance`: Ensuring adherence to data privacy and compliance regulations by tracking data flow and transformations throughout its lifecycle.
  - `Data Optimization`: Identifying redundant data processing steps and optimizing data flows to improve efficiency.

Apache Flink provides a native lineage support for the community requirement by providing an internal lineage data model and [Job Status Listener]({{< ref "docs/deployment/advanced/job_status_listener" >}}) for
developer to integrate lineage metadata into external lineage system, for example [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io). When a job is created in Flink runtime, the JobCreatedEvent 
contains the Lineage Graph metadata will be sent to Job Status Listeners.

# Lineage Data Model
Flink native lineage interfaces are defined in two layers. The first layer is the generic interface for all Flink jobs and connector, and the second layer defines
the extended interfaces for Table and DataStream independently. The interface and class relationship are defined in the diagram below.

{{< img src="/fig/lineage_interfaces.png" alt="Lineage Data Model" width="80%">}}

By default, Table related lineage interfaces or classes are mainly used in Flink Table Runtime, thus Flink users doesn't need to touch these interfaces. Flink community will gradually support all
of common connectors, such as Kafka, JDBC, Cassandra, Hive and so on. If you have customized connector defined, you need to have customized source/sink implements the LineageVertexProvider interface.
Within a LineageVertex, a list of Lineage Dataset is defined as metadata for Flink source/sink. 


```java
@PublicEvolving
public interface LineageVertexProvider {
  LineageVertex getLineageVertex();
}
```

For the interface details, please refer to [FLIP-314](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-314%3A+Support+Customized+Job+Lineage+Listener).

# Naming Conventions
For each of Lineage Dataset, we need to define its own name and namespace to distinguish different data store and corresponding instance used in the connector of a Flink application. 

| Data Store | Connector Type  | Namespace                              | Name                                                     | 
|------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Kafka      | Kafka Connector | kafka://{bootstrap server host}:{port} | topic                                                    |
| MySQL      | JDBC Connector  | mysql://{host}:{port}                  | {database}.{table}                                       | 
| Sql Server | JDBC Connector  | sqlserver://{host}:{port}              | {database}.{table}                                       | 
| Postgres   | JDBC Connector  | postgres://{host}:{port}               | {database}.{schema}.{table}                              | 
| Oracle     | JDBC Connector  | oracle://{host}:{port}                 | {serviceName}.{schema}.{table} or {sid}.{schema}.{table} | 
| Trino      | JDBC Connector  | trino://{host}:{port}                  | {catalog}.{schema}.{table}                               | 
| OceanBase  | JDBC Connector  | oceanbase://{host}:{port}              | {database}.{table}                                       | 
| DB2        | JDBC Connector  | db2://{host}:{port}                    | {database}.{table}                                       | 
| CrateDB    | JDBC Connector  | cratedb://{host}:{port}                | {database}.{table}                                       | 

It is a running table. More and more naming info will be added after lineage integration is finished for a specific connector.
