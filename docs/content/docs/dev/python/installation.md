# Installation

## Environment Requirements

{{< hint info >}}
Python version (3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8) is required for PyFlink. Please run the following command to make sure that it meets the requirements:
{{< /hint >}}

```bash
$ python --version
# the version printed here must be 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8
```

## Environment Setup

Your system may include multiple Python versions, and thus also include multiple Python binary executables. You can run the following
`ls` command to find out what Python binary executables are available in your system:

```bash
$ ls /usr/bin/python*
```

To satisfy the PyFlink requirement regarding the Python environment version, you can choose to soft link `python` to point to your `python3` interpreter:

```bash
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 python
```

In addition to creating a soft link, you can also choose to create a Python virtual environment (`venv`). You can refer to the [Preparing Python Virtual Environment]({{< ref "docs/dev/python/faq" >}}#preparing-python-virtual-environment) documentation page for details on how to achieve that setup.

If you donâ€™t want to use a soft link to change the system's `python` interpreter point to, you can use the configuration way to specify the Python interpreter.
For specifying the Python interpreter used to compile the jobs, you can refer to the [python client executable]({{< ref "docs/dev/python/python_config" >}}#python-client-executable)
For specifying the Python interpreter used to execute the python UDF worker, you can refer to the [python.executable]({{< ref "docs/dev/python/python_config" >}}#python-executable)

## Installation of PyFlink

PyFlink is available through [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/apache-flink/) as a regular Python package and can be installed as follows:

{{< stable >}}
```bash
$ python -m pip install apache-flink {{< version >}}
```
{{< /stable >}}
{{< unstable >}}
```bash
$ python -m pip install apache-flink
```
{{< /unstable >}}

You can also build PyFlink from source by following the [development guide]({{< ref "docs/flinkDev/building" >}}#build-pyflink).
