# Flink and Map Reduce compatibility

Flink is compatible with Apache Hadoop MapReduce interfaces and therefore allows
reusing code that was implemented for Hadoop MapReduce.

You can:

- use Hadoop's `Writable` [data types]({{< ref "docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/serialization/types_serialization" >}}#supported-data-types) in Flink programs.
- use any Hadoop `InputFormat` as a [DataSource]({{ ref "docs/dev/connectors/formats/hadoop.html" >}}#data-sources).
- use any Hadoop `OutputFormat` as a [DataSink]({{ ref "docs/dev/connectors/formats/hadoop.html" >}}#data-sinks).
- use a Hadoop `Mapper` as [FlatMapFunction]({{ ref "docs/dev/dataset/transformations" >}}#flatmap).
- use a Hadoop `Reducer` as [GroupReduceFunction]({{ ref "docs/dev/dataset/transformations" >}}#groupreduce-on-grouped-dataset).

This document shows how to use existing Hadoop MapReduce code with Flink. Please refer to the
[Connecting to other systems]({{< ref "docs/deployment/filesystems/overview" >}}#hadoop-file-system-hdfs-and-its-other-implementations) guide for reading from Hadoop supported file systems.

## Project Configuration

Support for Hadoop is contained in the `flink-hadoop-compatibility`
Maven module.

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` to use hadoop

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
	<artifactId>flink-hadoop-compatibility{{< scala_version >}}</artifactId>
	<version>{{< version >}}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to run your Flink application locally (e.g. from your IDE), you also need to add 
a `hadoop-client` dependency such as:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
    <artifactId>hadoop-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.8.3</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Using Hadoop Mappers and Reducers

Hadoop Mappers are semantically equivalent to Flink's [FlatMapFunctions](dataset_transformations.html#flatmap) and Hadoop Reducers are equivalent to Flink's [GroupReduceFunctions](dataset_transformations.html#groupreduce-on-grouped-dataset). Flink provides wrappers for implementations of Hadoop MapReduce's `Mapper` and `Reducer` interfaces, i.e., you can reuse your Hadoop Mappers and Reducers in regular Flink programs. At the moment, only the Mapper and Reduce interfaces of Hadoop's mapred API (`org.apache.hadoop.mapred`) are supported.

The wrappers take a `DataSet<Tuple2<KEYIN,VALUEIN>>` as input and produce a `DataSet<Tuple2<KEYOUT,VALUEOUT>>` as output where `KEYIN` and `KEYOUT` are the keys and `VALUEIN` and `VALUEOUT` are the values of the Hadoop key-value pairs that are processed by the Hadoop functions. For Reducers, Flink offers a wrapper for a GroupReduceFunction with (`HadoopReduceCombineFunction`) and without a Combiner (`HadoopReduceFunction`). The wrappers accept an optional `JobConf` object to configure the Hadoop Mapper or Reducer.

Flink's function wrappers are

- `org.apache.flink.hadoopcompatibility.mapred.HadoopMapFunction`,
- `org.apache.flink.hadoopcompatibility.mapred.HadoopReduceFunction`, and
- `org.apache.flink.hadoopcompatibility.mapred.HadoopReduceCombineFunction`.

and can be used as regular Flink [FlatMapFunctions](dataset_transformations.html#flatmap) or [GroupReduceFunctions](dataset_transformations.html#groupreduce-on-grouped-dataset).

The following example shows how to use Hadoop `Mapper` and `Reducer` functions.

```java
// Obtain data to process somehow.
DataSet<Tuple2<LongWritable, Text>> text = [...]

DataSet<Tuple2<Text, LongWritable>> result = text
  // use Hadoop Mapper (Tokenizer) as MapFunction
  .flatMap(new HadoopMapFunction<LongWritable, Text, Text, LongWritable>(
    new Tokenizer()
  ))
  .groupBy(0)
  // use Hadoop Reducer (Counter) as Reduce- and CombineFunction
  .reduceGroup(new HadoopReduceCombineFunction<Text, LongWritable, Text, LongWritable>(
    new Counter(), new Counter()
  ));
```

**Please note:** The Reducer wrapper works on groups as defined by Flink's [groupBy()](dataset_transformations.html#transformations-on-grouped-dataset) operation. It does not consider any custom partitioners, sort or grouping comparators you might have set in the `JobConf`.

## Complete Hadoop WordCount Example

The following example shows a complete WordCount implementation using Hadoop data types, Input- and OutputFormats, and Mapper and Reducer implementations.

```java
ExecutionEnvironment env = ExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

// Set up the Hadoop TextInputFormat.
Job job = Job.getInstance();
HadoopInputFormat<LongWritable, Text> hadoopIF =
  new HadoopInputFormat<LongWritable, Text>(
    new TextInputFormat(), LongWritable.class, Text.class, job
  );
TextInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(inputPath));

// Read data using the Hadoop TextInputFormat.
DataSet<Tuple2<LongWritable, Text>> text = env.createInput(hadoopIF);

DataSet<Tuple2<Text, LongWritable>> result = text
  // use Hadoop Mapper (Tokenizer) as MapFunction
  .flatMap(new HadoopMapFunction<LongWritable, Text, Text, LongWritable>(
    new Tokenizer()
  ))
  .groupBy(0)
  // use Hadoop Reducer (Counter) as Reduce- and CombineFunction
  .reduceGroup(new HadoopReduceCombineFunction<Text, LongWritable, Text, LongWritable>(
    new Counter(), new Counter()
  ));

// Set up the Hadoop TextOutputFormat.
HadoopOutputFormat<Text, LongWritable> hadoopOF =
  new HadoopOutputFormat<Text, LongWritable>(
    new TextOutputFormat<Text, LongWritable>(), job
  );
hadoopOF.getConfiguration().set("mapreduce.output.textoutputformat.separator", " ");
TextOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(outputPath));

// Emit data using the Hadoop TextOutputFormat.
result.output(hadoopOF);

// Execute Program
env.execute("Hadoop WordCount");
```
