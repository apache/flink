# Materialized Table Statements

Flink SQL supports the following Materialized Table statements for now:
- [CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE](#create-materialized-table)
- [ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE](#alter-materialized-table)
- [DROP MATERIALIZED TABLE](#drop-materialized-table)

# CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name

[ ([ <table_constraint> ]) ]

[COMMENT table_comment]

[PARTITIONED BY (partition_column_name1, partition_column_name2, ...)]

[WITH (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]

FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '<num>' { SECOND | MINUTE | HOUR | DAY }

[REFRESH_MODE = { CONTINUOUS | FULL }]

AS <select_statement>

<table_constraint>:
  [CONSTRAINT constraint_name] PRIMARY KEY (column_name, ...) NOT ENFORCED
```

## PRIMARY KEY

`PRIMARY KEY` defines an optional list of columns that uniquely identifies each row within the table. The column as the primary key must be non-null.

## PARTITIONED BY

`PARTITIONED BY` defines an optional list of columns to partition the materialized table. A directory is created for each partition if this materialized table is used as a filesystem sink.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Create a materialized table and specify the partition field as `ds`.
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table
    PARTITIONED BY (ds)
    FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' HOUR
    AS SELECT 
        ds
    FROM
        ...
```

<span class="label label-danger">Note</span>
- The partition column must be included in the query statement of the materialized table.

## WITH Options

`WITH Options` are used to specify the materialized table properties, including [connector options]({{< ref "docs/connectors/table/" >}}) and [time format option]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/config" >}}#partition-fields-date-formatter) for partition fields.

```sql
-- Create a materialized table, specify the partition field as 'ds', and the corresponding time format as 'yyyy-MM-dd'
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table
    PARTITIONED BY (ds)
    WITH (
        'format' = 'json',
        'partition.fields.ds.date-formatter' = 'yyyy-MM-dd'
    )
    ...
```

As shown in the above example, we specified the date-formatter option for the `ds` partition column. During each scheduling, the scheduling time will be converted to the ds partition value. For example, for a scheduling time of `2024-01-01 00:00:00`, only the partition `ds = '2024-01-01'` will be refreshed.

<span class="label label-danger">Note</span>
- The [partition.fields.#.date-formatter]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/config" >}}#partition-fields-date-formatter) option only works in full mode.
- The field in the [partition.fields.#.date-formatter]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/config" >}}#partition-fields-date-formatter) must be a valid string type partition field.

## FRESHNESS

`FRESHNESS` defines the data freshness of a materialized table.

**FRESHNESS and Refresh Mode Relationship**

FRESHNESS defines the maximum amount of time that the materialized tableâ€™s content should lag behind updates to the base tables. It does two things, firstly it determines the [refresh mode]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/materialized-table/overview" >}}#refresh-mode) of the materialized table through [configuration]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/config" >}}#materialized-table-refresh-mode-freshness-threshold), followed by determines the data refresh frequency to meet the actual data freshness requirements.

**Explanation of FRESHNESS Parameter**

The FRESHNESS parameter range is INTERVAL `'<num>'` { SECOND | MINUTE | HOUR | DAY }. `'<num>'` must be a positive integer, and in FULL mode, `'<num>'` should be a common divisor of the respective time interval unit.

**Examples:**
(Assuming `materialized-table.refresh-mode.freshness-threshold` is 30 minutes)

```sql
-- The corresponding refresh pipeline is a streaming job with a checkpoint interval of 1 second
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' SECOND

-- The corresponding refresh pipeline is a real-time job with a checkpoint interval of 1 minute
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' MINUTE

-- The corresponding refresh pipeline is a scheduled workflow with a schedule cycle of 1 hour
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' HOUR

-- The corresponding refresh pipeline is a scheduled workflow with a schedule cycle of 1 day
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' DAY
```

**Invalid `FRESHNESS` Examples:**

```sql
-- Interval is a negative number
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '-1' SECOND

-- Interval is 0
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '0' SECOND

-- Interval is in months or years
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' MONTH
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' YEAR

-- In FULL mode, the interval is not a common divisor of the respective time range
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '60' SECOND
FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '5' HOUR
```

<span class="label label-danger">Note</span>
- The materialized table data will be refreshed as closely as possible within the defined freshness but cannot guarantee complete satisfaction.
- In CONTINUOUS mode, setting a data freshness interval that is too short can impact job performance as it aligns with the checkpoint interval. To optimize checkpoint performance, consider [enabling-changelog]({{< ref "docs/ops/state/state_backends" >}}#incremental-checkpoints).
- In FULL mode, data freshness must be translated into a cron expression, consequently, only freshness intervals within predefined time spans are presently accommodated, this design ensures alignment with cron's capabilities. Specifically, support for the following freshness:
    - Second: 30, 15, 10, 5, 2, and 1 second intervals.
    - Minute: 30, 15, 10, 5, 2, and 1 minute intervals.
    - Hour: 8, 4, 2, and 1 hour intervals.
    - Day: 1 day.

## REFRESH_MODE

`REFRESH_MODE` is used to explicitly specify the refresh mode of the materialized table. The specified mode takes precedence over the framework's automatic inference to meet specific scenarios' needs.

**Examples:**
(Assuming `materialized-table.refresh-mode.freshness-threshold` is 30 minutes)

```sql
-- The refresh mode of the created materialized table is CONTINUOUS, and the job's checkpoint interval is 1 hour.
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table
    REFRESH_MODE = CONTINUOUS
    FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' HOUR
    AS SELECT
       ...    

-- The refresh mode of the created materialized table is FULL, and the job's schedule cycle is 10 minutes.
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table
    REFRESH_MODE = FULL
    FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '10' MINUTE
    AS SELECT
       ...    
```

## AS <select_statement>

This clause is used to define the query for populating materialized view data. The upstream table can be a materialized table, table, or view. The select statement supports all Flink SQL [Queries]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/sql/queries/overview" >}}).

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table
    FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '10' SECOND
    AS SELECT * FROM kafka_catalog.db1.kafka_table;
```

## Examples

**(Assuming `materialized-table.refresh-mode.freshness-threshold` is 30 minutes)**

Create a materialized table with a data freshness of 10 seconds and the derived refresh mode is CONTINUOUS:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table_continuous
    PARTITIONED BY (ds)
    WITH (
        'format' = 'debezium-json',
        'partition.fields.ds.date-formatter' = 'yyyy-MM-dd'
    )
    FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '10' SECOND
    AS 
    SELECT 
        k.ds,
        k.user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count,
        SUM(k.amount) AS total_amount,
        MAX(u.age) AS max_age
    FROM 
        kafka_catalog.db1.kafka_table k
    JOIN 
        user_catalog.db1.user_table u
    ON 
        k.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE 
        k.event_type = 'purchase'
    GROUP BY 
        k.ds, k.user_id
```

Create a materialized table with a data freshness of 1 hour and the derived refresh mode is FULL:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table_full
    PARTITIONED BY (ds)
    WITH (
        'format' = 'json',
        'partition.fields.ds.date-formatter' = 'yyyy-MM-dd'
    )
    FRESHNESS = INTERVAL '1' HOUR
    AS 
    SELECT 
        p.ds,
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        AVG(s.sale_price) AS avg_sale_price,
        SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM 
        paimon_catalog.db1.product_table p
    LEFT JOIN 
        paimon_catalog.db1.sales_table s
    ON 
        p.product_id = s.product_id
    WHERE 
        p.category = 'electronics'
    GROUP BY 
        p.ds, p.product_id, p.product_name
```

## Limitations

- Does not support explicitly specifying columns
- Does not support modified query statements
- Does not support using temporary tables, temporary views, or temporary functions in the select query

# ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name SUSPEND | RESUME [WITH (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)] | REFRESH [PARTITION partition_spec]
```

`ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE` is used to manage materialized tables. This command allows users to suspend and resume refresh pipeline of materialized tables and manually trigger data refreshes.

## SUSPEND

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name SUSPEND
```

`SUSPEND` is used to pause the background refresh pipeline of the materialized table.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Specify SAVEPOINT path before pausing
SET 'execution.checkpointing.savepoint-dir' = 'hdfs://savepoint_path';

-- Suspend the specified materialized table
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table SUSPEND;
```

<span class="label label-danger">Note</span>
- When suspending a table in CONTINUOUS mode, the job will be paused using STOP WITH SAVEPOINT by default. You need to set the SAVEPOINT save path using [parameters]({{< ref "docs/deployment/config" >}}#execution-checkpointing-savepoint-dir).

## RESUME

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name RESUME [WITH (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]
```

`RESUME` is used to resume the refresh pipeline of a materialized table. Materialized table dynamic options can be specified through `WITH options` clause, which only take effect on the current refreshed pipeline and are not persistent.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Resume the specified materialized table
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table RESUME;

-- Resume the specified materialized table and specify sink parallelism
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table RESUME WITH ('sink.parallelism'='10');
```

## REFRESH

```
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE [catalog_name.][db_name.]table_name REFRESH [PARTITION partition_spec]
```

`REFRESH` is used to proactively trigger the refresh of the materialized table.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Refresh the entire table data
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table REFRESH;

-- Refresh specified partition data
ALTER MATERIALIZED TABLE my_materialized_table REFRESH PARTITION (ds='2024-06-28');
```

<span class="label label-danger">Note</span>
- The REFRESH operation will start a Flink batch job to refresh the materialized table data.

# DROP MATERIALIZED TABLE

```text
DROP MATERIALIZED TABLE [IF EXISTS] [catalog_name.][database_name.]table_name
```

When dropping a materialized table, the background refresh pipeline will be deleted first, and then the metadata corresponding to the materialized table will be removed from the Catalog.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Delete the specified materialized table
DROP MATERIALIZED TABLE IF EXISTS my_materialized_table;
```
