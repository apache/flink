# Hive Compatibility

Apache Flink also provides compatibility with Apache Hive, including running SQL with Hive dialect.

Hive Dialect
------------------

With Hive dialect, user can write SQL in Hive syntax and run it in Flink with both `BATCH` and `STREAM` mode.
Please refer to [Hive Dialect]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/hiveCompatibility/hiveDialect/overview" >}}) for more details.
