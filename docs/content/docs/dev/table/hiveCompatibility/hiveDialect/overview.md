# Hive Dialect

Flink allows users to write SQL statements in Hive syntax when Hive dialect is used.
By providing compatibility with Hive syntax, we aim to improve the interoperability with Hive and reduce the scenarios when users need to switch between Flink and Hive in order to execute different statements.

## Use Hive Dialect

Flink currently supports two SQL dialects: `default` and `hive`. You need to switch to Hive dialect
before you can write in Hive syntax. The following describes how to set dialect with
SQL Client and Table API. Also notice that you can dynamically switch dialect for each
statement you execute. There's no need to restart a session to use a different dialect.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Note:**

- To use Hive dialect, you have to add dependencies related to Hive. Please refer to [Hive dependencies]({{< ref "docs/connectors/table/hive/overview" >}}#dependencies) for how to add the dependencies.
- Please make sure the current catalog is [HiveCatalog]({{< ref "docs/connectors/table/hive/hive_catalog" >}}). Otherwise, it will fall back to Flink's `default` dialect.
- In order to have better syntax and semantic compatibility, it’s highly recommended to load [HiveModule]({{< ref "docs/connectors/table/hive/hive_functions" >}}#use-hive-built-in-functions-via-hivemodule) and
  place it first in the module list, so that Hive built-in functions can be picked up during function resolution.
  Please refer [here]({{< ref "docs/dev/table/modules" >}}#how-to-load-unload-use-and-list-modules) for how to change resolution order.
- Hive dialect only supports 2-part identifiers, so you can't specify catalog for an identifier.
- While all Hive versions support the same syntax, whether a specific feature is available still depends on the
  [Hive version]({{< ref "docs/connectors/table/hive/overview" >}}#supported-hive-versions) you use. For example, updating database
  location is only supported in Hive-2.4.0 or later.

### SQL Client

SQL dialect can be specified via the `table.sql-dialect` property.
Therefore，you can set the dialect after the SQL Client has launched.

```bash
Flink SQL> SET 'table.sql-dialect' = 'hive'; -- to use hive dialect
[INFO] Session property has been set.

Flink SQL> SET 'table.sql-dialect' = 'default'; -- to use default dialect
[INFO] Session property has been set.
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**Note:**
Since Flink 1.15, when you want to use Hive dialect in Flink SQL client, you have to swap the jar `flink-table-planner-loader` located in `FLINK_HOME/lib`
with the jar `flink-table-planner_2.12` located in `FLINK_HOME/opt`. Otherwise, it'll throw the following exception:

### Table API

You can set dialect for your TableEnvironment with Table API.

{{< tabs "f19e5e09-c58d-424d-999d-275106d1d5b3" >}}
{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
EnvironmentSettings settings = EnvironmentSettings.inStreamingMode();
TableEnvironment tableEnv = TableEnvironment.create(settings);
// to use hive dialect
tableEnv.getConfig().setSqlDialect(SqlDialect.HIVE);
// to use default dialect
tableEnv.getConfig().setSqlDialect(SqlDialect.DEFAULT);
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Python" >}}
```python
from pyflink.table import *
settings = EnvironmentSettings.in_batch_mode()
t_env = TableEnvironment.create(settings)
# to use hive dialect
t_env.get_config().set_sql_dialect(SqlDialect.HIVE)
# to use default dialect
t_env.get_config().set_sql_dialect(SqlDialect.DEFAULT)
```
