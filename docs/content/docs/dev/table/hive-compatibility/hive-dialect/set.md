# SET Statements

## Description

The `SET` statement sets a property which provide a ways to set variables for a session and
configuration property including system variable and Hive configuration.
But environment variable can't be set via `SET` statement. The behavior of `SET` with Hive dialect is compatible to Hive's.

## EXAMPLES

```sql
-- set Flink's configuration
SET table.sql-dialect=default;

-- set Hive's configuration
SET hiveconf:k1=v1;

-- set system property
SET system:k2=v2;

-- set vairable for current session
SET hivevar:k3=v3;

-- get value for configuration
SET table.sql-dialect;
SET hiveconf:k1;
SET system:k2;
SET hivevar:k3;

-- only print Flink's configuration
SET;

-- print all configurations
SET -v;
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**Note:**
- In Hive, the `SET` command `SET xx=yy` whose key has no prefix is equivalent to `SET hiveconf:xx=yy`, which means it'll set it to Hive Conf.
  But in Flink, with Hive dialect, such `SET` command `set xx=yy` will set `xx` with value `yy` to Flink's configuration.
  So, if you want to set configuration to Hive's Conf, please add the prefix `hiveconf:`, using the  `SET` command like `SET hiveconf:xx=yy`.
- In Hive dialect, the `key`/`value` to be set shouldn't be quoted.
