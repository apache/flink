# Time Travel

{{< label Batch >}} {{< label Streaming >}}

`Time travel` is a SQL syntax used for querying historical data. It allows users to specify a point in time and query the corresponding table data.
<span class="label label-danger">Attention</span> Currently, `time travel` requires the corresponding catalog that the table belongs to implements the {{< gh_link file="flink-table/flink-table-common/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/catalog/Catalog.java" name="getTable(ObjectPath tablePath, long timestamp)" >}} method.

The `timestamp_expression` represents the historical point in time you're interested in. This can be a specific timestamp or an expression related to time, such as relative time or a function.

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF timestamp_expression
```

**Parameter Specification:**

- `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF timestamp_expression`ï¼šUsed to query data before a specific time point, this expression can only be applied to physical tables and not views or subqueries.

## Limitation

<span class="label label-danger">Attention</span> The time expressions used in `time travel` only support `TIMESTAMP` constant expressions, `TIMESTAMP` addition and subtraction operations, as well as some built-in functions and UDFs.

### Constant Expression

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2023-07-31 00:00:00'
```

### Constant Expression Addition and Subtraction

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2023-07-31 00:00:00' - INTERVAL '1' DAY
```

### Time Function or UDF (Partial Supported)

When `UDF` or `functions` are used in a `time expression`, due to the limitations of the current framework,
some expressions cannot be directly converted into a `TIMESTAMP` constant during SQL parsing and an exception will be thrown.

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(0, 3)
```

The corresponding exceptions are as follows:

```bash
Unsupported time travel expression: TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(0, 3) for the expression can not be reduced to a constant by Flink.
```

## Time Zone Handling

The data type generated by the TIMESTAMP expression is TIMESTAMP type, but there's a special case in the time travel statement.
When executing the time travel statement, the framework will convert the TIMESTAMP type to the LONG type based on the local time zone.
Therefore, the results of the same time travel query statement may vary when queried in different time zones.
