# Time Travel

{{< label Batch >}} {{< label Streaming >}}

`TIME TRAVEL` is an SQL syntax used for querying historical data. It allows users to specify a point in time, query the corresponding table data.

<span class="label label-danger">Attention</span> Currently, `TIME TRAVEL` requires corresponding catalog that the table belongs to implement the {{< gh_link file="flink-table/flink-table-common/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/catalog/Catalog.java" name="getTable(ObjectPath tablePath, long timestamp)" >}} methodã€‚

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2023-07-31 00:00:00'
```

## Expression Description

<span class="label label-danger">Attention</span> `TIME TRAVEL` currently only supports some constant expressions and does not support the use of functions or udf.

### Constant Expression

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2023-07-31 00:00:00'
```

### Constant Expression Addition and Subtraction

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2023-07-31 00:00:00' - INTERVAL '1' DAY
```

### Time Function or UDF (Not Supported)

When using UDF or functions, a valid timestamp cannot be generated due to limitations of the current framework, and an exception will be thrown when executing the following query.

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM paimon_tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(0, 3)
```

## Time Zone Handling

By default, the data type generated by the TIMESTAMP expression should be TIMESTAMP type, while the 
interface provided by Catalog is `getTable(ObjectPath tablePath, long timestamp)`.
When executing the time travel statement, the framework will convert TIMESTAMP type time to LONG value based on the local time zone. Therefore, the results of the same time travel query statement may vary when queried in different time zones.
