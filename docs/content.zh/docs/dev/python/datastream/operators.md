# Operators


Operators transform one or more DataStreams into a new DataStream. Programs can combine multiple transformations into 
sophisticated dataflow topologies.



# DataStream Transformations

DataStream programs in Flink are regular programs that implement transformations on data streams (e.g., mapping, 
filtering, reducing). Please see [operators]({{< ref "docs/dev/datastream/operators/overview" >}})
for an overview of the available stream transformations in Python DataStream API.

# Functions
Most transformations require a user-defined function as input to define the functionality of the transformation. The 
following describes different ways of defining user-defined functions.

## Implementing Function Interfaces
Different Function interfaces are provided for different transformations in the Python DataStream API. For example, 
`MapFunction` is provided for the `map` transformation, `FilterFunction` is provided for the `filter` transformation, etc.
Users can implement the corresponding Function interface according to the type of the transformation. Take MapFunction for
instance: 


```python
# Implementing MapFunction
class MyMapFunction(MapFunction):
    
    def map(self, value):
        return value + 1
        
data_stream = env.from_collection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], type_info=Types.INT())
mapped_stream = data_stream.map(MyMapFunction(), output_type=Types.INT())
```


<span class="label label-info">Note</span> In Python DataStream API, users can specify the output type information of the transformation explicityly. If not 
specified, the output type will be `Types.PICKLED_BYTE_ARRAY` so that data will be in a form of byte array generated by 
the pickle seriallizer. For more details about the `Pickle Serialization`, please refer to [DataTypes]({{< ref "docs/dev/python/datastream/data_types" >}}#pickle-serialization).

## Lambda Function
As shown in the following example, all the transformations can also accept a lambda function to define the functionality of the transformation:

```python
data_stream = env.from_collection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], type_info=Types.INT())
mapped_stream = data_stream.map(lambda x: x + 1, output_type=Types.INT())
```

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Operations ConnectedStream.map() and ConnectedStream.flat_map() do not support
lambda function and must accept `CoMapFunction` and `CoFlatMapFunction` seperately.

## Python Function
Users can also use Python function:

```python
def my_map_func(value):
    return value + 1

data_stream = env.from_collection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], type_info=Types.INT())
mapped_stream = data_stream.map(my_map_func, output_type=Types.INT())
```
