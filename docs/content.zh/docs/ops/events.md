# Events

Flink exposes a event reporting system that allows gathering and exposing events to external systems.

## Reporting events

You can access the event system from any user function that extends [RichFunction]({{< ref "docs/dev/datastream/user_defined_functions" >}}#rich-functions) by calling `getRuntimeContext().getMetricGroup()`.
This method returns a `MetricGroup` object via which you can report a new single event.

### Reporting single Event


An `Event` represents something that happened in Flink at certain point of time, that will be reported to a `TraceReporter`.
To report an `Event` you can use the `MetricGroup#addEvent(EventBuilder)` method.

{{< tabs "9612d275-bdda-4322-a01f-ae6da805e917" >}}
{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
public class MyClass {
    void doSomething() {
        // (...)
        metricGroup.addEvent(
                Event.builder(MyClass.class, "SomeEvent")
                        .setObservedTsMillis(observedTs) // Optional
                        .setAttribute("foo", "bar"); // Optional
    }
}
```

Currently reporting Events from Python is not supported.

## Reporter

For information on how to set up Flink's event reporters please take a look at the [event reporters documentation]({{< ref "docs/deployment/event_reporters" >}}).

## System traces

Flink reports events listed below.

The tables below generally feature 5 columns:

* The "Scope" column describes what is that trace reported scope.

* The "Name" column describes the name of the reported trace.

* The "Attributes" column lists the names of all attributes that are reported with the given trace.

* The "Description" column provides information as to what a given attribute is reporting.
