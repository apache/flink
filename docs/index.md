This documentation is for Apache Flink version {{ site.version_title }}. These pages were built at: {% build_time %}.

Apache Flink is an open source platform for distributed stream and batch data processing. Flinkâ€™s core is a streaming dataflow engine that provides data distribution, communication, and fault tolerance for distributed computations over data streams. Flink builds batch processing on top of the streaming engine, overlaying native iteration support, managed memory, and program optimization.

## First Steps

* **Code Walkthroughs**: Follow step-by-step guides and implement a simple application or query in one of Flink's APIs. 
  * [Implement a DataStream application]({% link try-flink/datastream_api.md %})
  * [Write a Table API query]({% link try-flink/table_api.md %})

* **Docker Playgrounds**: Set up a sandboxed Flink environment in just a few minutes to explore and play with Flink.
  * [Run and manage Flink streaming applications]({% try-flink/flink-operations-playground.md %})

* **Concepts**: Learn about Flink's concepts to better understand the documentation.
  * [Stateful Stream Processing](concepts/stateful-stream-processing.html)
  * [Timely Stream Processing](concepts/timely-stream-processing.html)
  * [Flink Architecture](concepts/flink-architecture.html)
  * [Glossary](concepts/glossary.html)

## API References
