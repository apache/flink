### Try Flink

Apache Flink is an open source platform with expressive APIs for defining stream and batch data processing jobs, and a robust and scalable engine for executing those jobs.

To quickly get a general understanding of how Flink works and what it offers for your use case, work your way through one of these tutorials:

* [Fraud Detection with the DataStream API]({% link try-flink/datastream_api.md %})
* [Real Time Reporting with the Table API]({% link try-flink/table_api.md %})
* [Intro to the Python Table API]({% link try-flink/python_table_api.md %})
* [Flink Operations Playground]({% link try-flink/flink-operations-playground.md %})

### Learn Flink

* Our [Self-paced Training Course]({% link learn-flink/index.md %}) includes a set of lessons and hands-on exercises that provide a step-by-step introduction to Flink.

* The [Concepts]({% link concepts/index.md %}) section explains what you need to know about Flink before exploring the reference documentation.
