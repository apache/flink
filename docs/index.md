Apache Flink is a platform for efficient, distributed, general-purpose data processing.
It features powerful programming abstractions in Java and Scala, a high-performance runtime, and
automatic program optimization. It has native support for iterations, incremental iterations, and
programs consisting of large DAGs of operations.

If you quickly want to try out the system, please look at one of the available quickstarts. For
a thorough introduction of the Flink API please refer to the
[Programming Guide](apis/programming_guide.html).
