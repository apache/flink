  Shortcode for embedding an image.
  This is more powerful than plain markdown
  because we can configure the HTML image tag
  properties.

  Parmeters: 
      - src: The absolute path to the image file (required)
      - alt: Image alt text (optional)
      - width: Image width (optional)
*/}}
<img 
  src="{{.Site.BaseURL}}{{ .Get "src" }}"
  alt="{{ .Get "alt" }}"
  width="{{ .Get "width" }}"
  style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"
