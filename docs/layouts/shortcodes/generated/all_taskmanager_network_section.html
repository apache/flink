In situations like that system will allow subtask to request overdraft buffers, so that the subtask can finish such uninterruptible action, without blocking unaligned checkpoints for long period of time. Overdraft buffers are provided on best effort basis only if the system has some unused buffers available. Subtask that has used overdraft buffers won't be allowed to process any more records until the overdraft buffers are returned to the pool.
