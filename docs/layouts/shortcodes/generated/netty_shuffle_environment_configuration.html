In credit-based flow control mode, this indicates how many floating credits are shared among all the input channels. The floating buffers are distributed based on backlog (real-time output buffers in the subpartition) feedback, and can help relieve back-pressure caused by unbalanced data distribution among the subpartitions. This value should be increased in case of higher round trip times between nodes and/or larger number of machines in the cluster.</td>

            <td>Number of max buffers that can be used for each channel. If a channel exceeds the number of max buffers, it will make the task become unavailable, cause the back pressure and block the data processing. This might speed up checkpoint alignment by preventing excessive growth of the buffered in-flight data in case of data skew and high number of configured floating buffers. This limit is not strictly guaranteed, and can be ignored by things like flatMap operators, records spanning multiple buffers or single timer producing large amount of data.</td>
