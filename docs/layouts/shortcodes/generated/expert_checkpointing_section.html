If this value is set to false, pay attention not to run several jobs with the same directory simultaneously. <br />WARNING: This is an advanced configuration. If set to false, users must ensure that no multiple jobs are run with the same checkpoint directory, and that no files exist other than those necessary for the restoration of the current job when starting a new job.</td>
