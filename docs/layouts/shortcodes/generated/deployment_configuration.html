This is intended for providing a clean way of reporting failures back to the user and is especially useful in combination with 'execution.shutdown-on-application-finish'. This option only works when the single job submission is enforced ('high-availability' is enabled). Please note that this is an experimental option and may be changed in the future.</td>
