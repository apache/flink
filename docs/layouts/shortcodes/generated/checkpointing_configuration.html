By default,  the checkpoint meta data and actual program state will be stored in the JobManager's memory directly. When 'state.checkpoint-storage' is set to 'jobmanager', if 'state.checkpoints.dir' is configured, the meta data of checkpoints will be persisted to the path specified by 'state.checkpoints.dir'. Otherwise, the meta data will be stored in the JobManager's memory.
