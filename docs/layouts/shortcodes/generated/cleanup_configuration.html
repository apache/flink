No retry will be initiated in case of failure. The job artifacts (and the job's JobResultStore entry) have to be cleaned up manually in case of a failure.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">fixed-delay</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">fixeddelay</code>: Cleanup attempts will be separated by a fixed interval up to the point where the cleanup is considered successful or a set amount of retries is reached. Reaching the configured limit means that the job artifacts (and the job's JobResultStore entry) might need to be cleaned up manually.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">exponential-delay</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">exponentialdelay</code>: Exponential delay restart strategy triggers the cleanup with an exponentially increasing delay up to the point where the cleanup succeeded or a set amount of retries is reached. Reaching the configured limit means that the job artifacts (and the job's JobResultStore entry) might need to be cleaned up manually.</li></ul>The default configuration relies on an exponentially delayed retry strategy with the given default values.</td>
