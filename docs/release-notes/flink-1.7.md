These release notes discuss important aspects, such as configuration, behavior, or dependencies, that changed between Flink 1.6 and Flink 1.7. Please read these notes carefully if you are planning to upgrade your Flink version to 1.7.

<!-- Should be removed once FLINK-10911 is fixed -->
### Scala shell does not work with Scala 2.12

Flink's Scala shell does not work with Scala 2.12.
Therefore, the module `flink-scala-shell` is not being released for Scala 2.12.

See [FLINK-10911](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10911) for more details.  

<!-- Remove once FLINK-10712 has been fixed -->
### Limitations of failover strategies
Flink's non-default failover strategies are still a very experimental feature which come with a set of limitations.
You should only use this feature if you are executing a stateless streaming job.
In any other cases, it is highly recommended to remove the config option `jobmanager.execution.failover-strategy` from your `flink-conf.yaml` or set it to `"full"`.

In order to avoid future problems, this feature has been removed from the documentation until it will be fixed.
See [FLINK-10880](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10880) for more details.
