# This controls if the violation store is writable
freeze.store.default.allowStoreUpdate=true

# Enable this if a new rule was added or the description of an existing rule has changed.
# It is needed to record future violations of this rule.
# If omitted, future violations of the rule will not be considered as violations as the initial store was not created for this rule.
#freeze.store.default.allowStoreCreation=true

# Enable this to record the current state of violations.
# This can make sense, because current violations are consciously accepted and should be added to the store
# By default we allow removing existing violations, but fail when new violations are added
# NOTE: Adding new violations should be avoided when possible. If the rule was correct to flag a new
#       violation, please try to avoid creating the violation. If the violation was created due to a
#       shortcoming of the rule, file a JIRA issue so the rule can be improved.
