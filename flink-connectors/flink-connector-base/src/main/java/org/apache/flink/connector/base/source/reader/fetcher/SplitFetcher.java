	 * instead of naively interrupt the thread.
	 *
	 * <p>The correctness can be think of in the following way. The purpose of wake up
	 * is to let the fetcher thread go to the very beginning of the running loop.
	 * There are three major events in each run of the loop.
	 * <ol>
	 *     <li>pick a task (blocking)
	 * 	   <li>assign the task to runningTask variable.
	 * 	   <li>run the runningTask. (blocking)
	 * </ol>
	 * We don't need to worry about things after step 3 because there is no blocking point
	 * anymore.
	 *
	 * <p>We always first set the wakeup flag when waking up the fetcher, then use the
	 * value of running task to determine where the fetcher thread is.
	 * <ul>
	 *     <li>
	 *         If runningThread is null, it is before step 2, so we should interrupt fetcher.
	 *         This interruption will not be propagated to the split reader, because the
	 *         wakeUp flag will prevent the fetchTask from running.
	 *     </li>
	 *     <li>
	 *         If runningThread is not null, it is after step 2. so we should wakeUp the
	 *         split reader instead of interrupt the fetcher.
	 *     </li>
	 * </ul>

	 * synchronize to ensure the wake up logic do not touch a different invocation.
