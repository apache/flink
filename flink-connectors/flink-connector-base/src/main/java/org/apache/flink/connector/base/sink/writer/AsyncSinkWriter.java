     * <p>The method is invoked with a set of request entries according to the buffering hints (and
     * the valid limits of the destination). The logic then needs to create and execute the request
     * asynchronously against the destination (ideally by batching together multiple request entries
     * to increase efficiency). The logic also needs to identify individual request entries that
     * were not persisted successfully and resubmit them using the {@code requestResult} callback.

     * <p>From a threading perspective, the mailbox thread will call this method and initiate the
     * asynchronous request to persist the {@code requestEntries}. NOTE: The client must support
     * asynchronous requests and the method called to persist the records must asynchronously
     * execute and return a future with the results of that request. A thread from the destination
     * client thread pool should complete the request and submit the failed entries that should be
     * retried. The {@code requestResult} will then trigger the mailbox thread to requeue the
     * unsuccessful elements.

     *
     * <pre>{@code
     * @Override
     * protected void submitRequestEntries
     *   (List<RequestEntryT> records, Consumer<Collection<RequestEntryT>> requestResult) {
     *     Future<Response> response = destinationClient.putRecords(records);
     *     response.whenComplete(
     *         (response, error) -> {
     *             if(error){
     *                 List<RequestEntryT> retryableFailedRecords = getRetryableFailed(response);
     *                 requestResult.accept(retryableFailedRecords);
     *             }else{
