OVERVIEW

The important configs. are listed near the top.  You should change
at least the setting for hbase.tmp.dir.  Other settings will change
dependent on whether you are running hbase in standalone mode or
distributed.  See the hbase reference guide for requirements and
guidance making configuration.

This file does not contain all possible configurations.  The file would be
much larger if it carried everything. The absent configurations will only be
found through source code reading.  The idea is that such configurations are
exotic and only those who would go to the trouble of reading a particular
section in the code would be knowledgeable or invested enough in ever wanting
to alter such configurations, so we do not list them here.  Listing all
possible configurations would overwhelm and obscure the important.
-->

<configuration>
	<!--Configs you will likely change are listed here at the top of the file.
    -->
	<property >
		<name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
		<value>${java.io.tmpdir}/hbase-${user.name}</value>
		<description>Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
			Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
			than '/tmp', the usual resolve for java.io.tmpdir, as the
			'/tmp' directory is cleared on machine restart.</description>
	</property>
	<property >
		<name>hbase.rootdir</name>
		<value>${hbase.tmp.dir}/hbase</value>
		<description>The directory shared by region servers and into
			which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
			to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
			HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
			running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
			hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default, we write
			to whatever ${hbase.tmp.dir} is set too -- usually /tmp --
			so change this configuration or else all data will be lost on
			machine restart.</description>
	</property>
	<property >
		<name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
		<value>false</value>
		<description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
			false for standalone mode and true for distributed mode.  If
			false, startup will run all HBase and ZooKeeper daemons together
			in the one JVM.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
		<value>localhost</value>
		<description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble
			(This config. should have been named hbase.zookeeper.ensemble).
			For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
			By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
			of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
			list of ZooKeeper ensemble servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
			this is the list of servers which hbase will start/stop ZooKeeper on as
			part of cluster start/stop.  Client-side, we will take this list of
			ensemble members and put it together with the hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort
			config. and pass it into zookeeper constructor as the connectString
			parameter.</description>

		<name>hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout</name>
		<value>600000</value>
		<description>Splitting a region, how long to wait on the file-splitting
			step before aborting the attempt. Default: 600000. This setting used
			to be known as hbase.regionserver.fileSplitTimeout in hbase-1.x.
			Split is now run master-side hence the rename (If a
			'hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout' setting found, will use it to
			prime the current 'hbase.master.fileSplitTimeout'

		<value>30</value>
		<description>Count of RPC Listener instances spun up on RegionServers.
			Same property is used by the Master for count of master handlers.
			Too many handlers can be counter-productive. Make it a multiple of
			CPU count. If mostly read-only, handlers count close to cpu count
			does well. Start with twice the CPU count and tune from there.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.handler.factor</name>

			A value of 1 means that each handler has its own queue.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio</name>
		<value>0</value>
		<description>Split the call queues into read and write queues.
			The specified interval (which should be between 0.0 and 1.0)
			will be multiplied by the number of call queues.
			A value of 0 indicate to not split the call queues, meaning that both read and write
			requests will be pushed to the same set of queues.
			A value lower than 0.5 means that there will be less read queues than write queues.
			A value of 0.5 means there will be the same number of read and write queues.
			A value greater than 0.5 means that there will be more read queues than write queues.
			A value of 1.0 means that all the queues except one are used to dispatch read requests.

			Example: Given the total number of call queues being 10
			a read.ratio of 0 means that: the 10 queues will contain both read/write requests.
			a read.ratio of 0.3 means that: 3 queues will contain only read requests
			and 7 queues will contain only write requests.
			a read.ratio of 0.5 means that: 5 queues will contain only read requests
			and 5 queues will contain only write requests.
			a read.ratio of 0.8 means that: 8 queues will contain only read requests
			and 2 queues will contain only write requests.
			a read.ratio of 1 means that: 9 queues will contain only read requests
			and 1 queues will contain only write requests.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.scan.ratio</name>
		<value>0</value>
		<description>Given the number of read call queues, calculated from the total number
			of call queues multiplied by the callqueue.read.ratio, the scan.ratio property
			will split the read call queues into small-read and long-read queues.
			A value lower than 0.5 means that there will be less long-read queues than short-read queues.
			A value of 0.5 means that there will be the same number of short-read and long-read queues.
			A value greater than 0.5 means that there will be more long-read queues than short-read queues
			A value of 0 or 1 indicate to use the same set of queues for gets and scans.

			Example: Given the total number of read call queues being 8
			a scan.ratio of 0 or 1 means that: 8 queues will contain both long and short read requests.
			a scan.ratio of 0.3 means that: 2 queues will contain only long-read requests
			and 6 queues will contain only short-read requests.
			a scan.ratio of 0.5 means that: 4 queues will contain only long-read requests
			and 4 queues will contain only short-read requests.
			a scan.ratio of 0.8 means that: 6 queues will contain only long-read requests
			and 2 queues will contain only short-read requests.

	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.msginterval</name>

	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.logroll.period</name>
		<value>3600000</value>
		<description>Period at which we will roll the commit log regardless
			of how many edits it has.</description>

	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.logroll.errors.tolerated</name>
		<value>2</value>
		<description>The number of consecutive WAL close errors we will allow
			before triggering a server abort.  A setting of 0 will cause the
			region server to abort if closing the current WAL writer fails during
			log rolling.  Even a small value (2 or 3) will allow a region server
			to ride over transient HDFS errors.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size</name>
		<value></value>
		<description>Maximum size of all memstores in a region server before new
			updates are blocked and flushes are forced. Defaults to 40% of heap (0.4).
			Updates are blocked and flushes are forced until size of all memstores
			in a region server hits hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size.lower.limit.
			The default value in this configuration has been intentionally left empty in order to
			honor the old hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.upperLimit property if present.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size.lower.limit</name>
		<value></value>
		<description>Maximum size of all memstores in a region server before flushes
			are forced. Defaults to 95% of hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size
			(0.95). A 100% value for this value causes the minimum possible flushing
			to occur when updates are blocked due to memstore limiting. The default
			value in this configuration has been intentionally left empty in order to
			honor the old hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.lowerLimit property if
			present.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.systemtables.compacting.memstore.type</name>
		<value>NONE</value>
		<description>Determines the type of memstore to be used for system tables like
			META, namespace tables etc. By default NONE is the type and hence we use the
			default memstore for all the system tables. If we need to use compacting
			memstore for system tables then set this property to BASIC/EAGER
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.optionalcacheflushinterval</name>
		<value>3600000</value>
		<description>
			Maximum amount of time an edit lives in memory before being automatically flushed.
			Default 1 hour. Set it to 0 to disable automatic flushing.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.dns.interface</name>
		<value>default</value>
		<description>The name of the Network Interface from which a region server
			should report its IP address.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.dns.nameserver</name>
		<value>default</value>
		<description>The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS)
			which a region server should use to determine the host name used by the
			master for communication and display purposes.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.regionSplitLimit</name>
		<value>1000</value>
		<description>
			Limit for the number of regions after which no more region splitting
			should take place. This is not hard limit for the number of regions
			but acts as a guideline for the regionserver to stop splitting after
			a certain limit. Default is set to 1000.
		</description>
	</property>

	<!--ZooKeeper configuration-->
	<property>
		<name>zookeeper.session.timeout</name>
		<value>90000</value>
		<description>ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. It is used in two different ways.
			First, this value is used in the ZK client that HBase uses to connect to the ensemble.
			It is also used by HBase when it starts a ZK server and it is passed as the 'maxSessionTimeout'.
			See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions.
			For example, if an HBase region server connects to a ZK ensemble that's also managed
			by HBase, then the session timeout will be the one specified by this configuration.
			But, a region server that connects to an ensemble managed with a different configuration
			will be subjected that ensemble's maxSessionTimeout. So, even though HBase might propose
			using 90 seconds, the ensemble can have a max timeout lower than this and it will take
			precedence. The current default maxSessionTimeout that ZK ships with is 40 seconds, which is lower than
			HBase's.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>zookeeper.znode.parent</name>
		<value>/hbase</value>
		<description>Root ZNode for HBase in ZooKeeper. All of HBase's ZooKeeper
			files that are configured with a relative path will go under this node.
			By default, all of HBase's ZooKeeper file paths are configured with a
			relative path, so they will all go under this directory unless changed.
		</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>zookeeper.znode.acl.parent</name>
		<value>acl</value>
		<description>Root ZNode for access control lists.</description>

	<property>
		<name>hbase.zookeeper.dns.interface</name>

		<description>The name of the Network Interface from which a ZooKeeper server
			should report its IP address.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.zookeeper.dns.nameserver</name>
		<value>default</value>
		<description>The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS)
			which a ZooKeeper server should use to determine the host name used by the
			master for communication and display purposes.</description>

			RegionServer and the call queue there keeps full</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.client.retries.number</name>
		<value>15</value>
		<description>Maximum retries.  Used as maximum for all retryable
			operations such as the getting of a cell's value, starting a row update,
			etc.  Retry interval is a rough function based on hbase.client.pause.  At
			first we retry at this interval but then with backoff, we pretty quickly reach
			retrying every ten seconds.  See HConstants#RETRY_BACKOFF for how the backup
			ramps up.  Change this setting and hbase.client.pause to suit your workload.</description>

		<name>hbase.client.perserver.requests.threshold</name>
		<value>2147483647</value>
		<description>The max number of concurrent pending requests for one server in all client threads
			(process level). Exceeding requests will be thrown ServerTooBusyException immediately to prevent
			user's threads being occupied and blocked by only one slow region server. If you use a fix
			number of threads to access HBase in a synchronous way, set this to a suitable value which is

	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.client.scanner.caching</name>
		<value>2147483647</value>
		<description>Number of rows that we try to fetch when calling next
			on a scanner if it is not served from (local, client) memory. This configuration
			works together with hbase.client.scanner.max.result.size to try and use the
			network efficiently. The default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE by default so that
			the network will fill the chunk size defined by hbase.client.scanner.max.result.size
			rather than be limited by a particular number of rows since the size of rows varies
			table to table. If you know ahead of time that you will not require more than a certain
			number of rows from a scan, this configuration should be set to that row limit via
			Scan#setCaching. Higher caching values will enable faster scanners but will eat up more
			memory and some calls of next may take longer and longer times when the cache is empty.
			Do not set this value such that the time between invocations is greater than the scanner
			timeout; i.e. hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.client.keyvalue.maxsize</name>
		<value>10485760</value>
		<description>Specifies the combined maximum allowed size of a KeyValue
			instance. This is to set an upper boundary for a single entry saved in a
			storage file. Since they cannot be split it helps avoiding that a region
			cannot be split any further because the data is too large. It seems wise
			to set this to a fraction of the maximum region size. Setting it to zero
			or less disables the check.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.server.keyvalue.maxsize</name>
		<value>10485760</value>
		<description>Maximum allowed size of an individual cell, inclusive of value and all key

		<value>16777216</value>
		<description>
			If FlushLargeStoresPolicy is used and there are multiple column families,
			then every time that we hit the total memstore limit, we find out all the
			column families whose memstores exceed a "lower bound" and only flush them
			while retaining the others in memory. The "lower bound" will be
			"hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size / column_family_number" by default
			unless value of this property is larger than that. If none of the families
			have their memstore size more than lower bound, all the memstores will be
			flushed (just as usual).

	<property>
		<name>hbase.hregion.preclose.flush.size</name>
		<value>5242880</value>
		<description>
			If the memstores in a region are this size or larger when we go
			to close, run a "pre-flush" to clear out memstores before we put up
			the region closed flag and take the region offline.  On close,
			a flush is run under the close flag to empty memory.  During
			this time the region is offline and we are not taking on any writes.
			If the memstore content is large, this flush could take a long time to
			complete.  The preflush is meant to clean out the bulk of the memstore
			before putting up the close flag and taking the region offline so the
			flush that runs under the close flag has little to do.</description>

		<name>hbase.hregion.majorcompaction</name>
		<value>604800000</value>
		<description>Time between major compactions, expressed in milliseconds. Set to 0 to disable
			time-based automatic major compactions. User-requested and size-based major compactions will
			still run. This value is multiplied by hbase.hregion.majorcompaction.jitter to cause
			compaction to start at a somewhat-random time during a given window of time. The default value
			is 7 days, expressed in milliseconds. If major compactions are causing disruption in your
			environment, you can configure them to run at off-peak times for your deployment, or disable
			time-based major compactions by setting this parameter to 0, and run major compactions in a
			cron job or by another external mechanism.</description>

		<value>3</value>
		<description> If more than this number of StoreFiles exist in any one Store

	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.flusher.count</name>
		<value>2</value>
		<description> The number of flush threads. With fewer threads, the MemStore flushes will be

			HDFS, and potentially causing more compactions. </description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles</name>
		<value>16</value>
		<description> If more than this number of StoreFiles exist in any one Store (one StoreFile
			is written per flush of MemStore), updates are blocked for this region until a compaction is
			completed, or until hbase.hstore.blockingWaitTime has been exceeded.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.blockingWaitTime</name>
		<value>90000</value>
		<description> The time for which a region will block updates after reaching the StoreFile limit

			blocking updates even if a compaction has not been completed.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.compaction.min</name>
		<value>3</value>
		<description>The minimum number of StoreFiles which must be eligible for compaction before
			compaction can run. The goal of tuning hbase.hstore.compaction.min is to avoid ending up with
			too many tiny StoreFiles to compact. Setting this value to 2 would cause a minor compaction
			each time you have two StoreFiles in a Store, and this is probably not appropriate. If you
			set this value too high, all the other values will need to be adjusted accordingly. For most
			cases, the default value is appropriate. In previous versions of HBase, the parameter
			hbase.hstore.compaction.min was named hbase.hstore.compactionThreshold.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.compaction.max</name>
		<value>10</value>
		<description>The maximum number of StoreFiles which will be selected for a single minor
			compaction, regardless of the number of eligible StoreFiles. Effectively, the value of
			hbase.hstore.compaction.max controls the length of time it takes a single compaction to
			complete. Setting it larger means that more StoreFiles are included in a compaction. For most
			cases, the default value is appropriate.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.compaction.min.size</name>
		<value>134217728</value>
		<description>A StoreFile (or a selection of StoreFiles, when using ExploringCompactionPolicy)
			smaller than this size will always be eligible for minor compaction.
			HFiles this size or larger are evaluated by hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio to determine if
			they are eligible. Because this limit represents the "automatic include" limit for all
			StoreFiles smaller than this value, this value may need to be reduced in write-heavy
			environments where many StoreFiles in the 1-2 MB range are being flushed, because every
			StoreFile will be targeted for compaction and the resulting StoreFiles may still be under the
			minimum size and require further compaction. If this parameter is lowered, the ratio check is
			triggered more quickly. This addressed some issues seen in earlier versions of HBase but
			changing this parameter is no longer necessary in most situations. Default: 128 MB expressed
			in bytes.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.compaction.max.size</name>
		<value>9223372036854775807</value>
		<description>A StoreFile (or a selection of StoreFiles, when using ExploringCompactionPolicy)
			larger than this size will be excluded from compaction. The effect of
			raising hbase.hstore.compaction.max.size is fewer, larger StoreFiles that do not get
			compacted often. If you feel that compaction is happening too often without much benefit, you
			can try raising this value. Default: the value of LONG.MAX_VALUE, expressed in bytes.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio</name>
		<value>1.2F</value>
		<description>For minor compaction, this ratio is used to determine whether a given StoreFile
			which is larger than hbase.hstore.compaction.min.size is eligible for compaction. Its
			effect is to limit compaction of large StoreFiles. The value of hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio
			is expressed as a floating-point decimal. A large ratio, such as 10, will produce a single
			giant StoreFile. Conversely, a low value, such as .25, will produce behavior similar to the
			BigTable compaction algorithm, producing four StoreFiles. A moderate value of between 1.0 and
			1.4 is recommended. When tuning this value, you are balancing write costs with read costs.
			Raising the value (to something like 1.4) will have more write costs, because you will
			compact larger StoreFiles. However, during reads, HBase will need to seek through fewer
			StoreFiles to accomplish the read. Consider this approach if you cannot take advantage of
			Bloom filters. Otherwise, you can lower this value to something like 1.0 to reduce the
			background cost of writes, and use Bloom filters to control the number of StoreFiles touched
			during reads. For most cases, the default value is appropriate.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio.offpeak</name>
		<value>5.0F</value>
		<description>Allows you to set a different (by default, more aggressive) ratio for determining
			whether larger StoreFiles are included in compactions during off-peak hours. Works in the
			same way as hbase.hstore.compaction.ratio. Only applies if hbase.offpeak.start.hour and
			hbase.offpeak.end.hour are also enabled.</description>
	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes</name>
		<value>0</value>
		<description>The amount of time to delay purging of delete markers with future timestamps. If
			unset, or set to 0, all delete markers, including those with future timestamps, are purged
			during the next major compaction. Otherwise, a delete marker is kept until the major compaction
			which occurs after the marker's timestamp plus the value of this setting, in milliseconds.

	<property>
		<name>hbase.offpeak.start.hour</name>
		<value>-1</value>

		<name>hbase.offpeak.end.hour</name>
		<value>-1</value>
		<description>The end of off-peak hours, expressed as an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive. Set

	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.thread.compaction.throttle</name>
		<value>2684354560</value>
		<description>There are two different thread pools for compactions, one for large compactions and
			the other for small compactions. This helps to keep compaction of lean tables (such as
			hbase:meta) fast. If a compaction is larger than this threshold, it
			goes into the large compaction pool. In most cases, the default value is appropriate. Default:
			2 x hbase.hstore.compaction.max x hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size (which defaults to 128MB).
			The value field assumes that the value of hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size is unchanged from
			the default.</description>

	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.majorcompaction.pagecache.drop</name>
		<value>true</value>
		<description>Specifies whether to drop pages read/written into the system page cache by

	</property>
	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.minorcompaction.pagecache.drop</name>
		<value>true</value>
		<description>Specifies whether to drop pages read/written into the system page cache by
			minor compactions. Setting it to true helps prevent minor compactions from
			polluting the page cache, which is most beneficial on clusters with low
			memory to storage ratio or very write heavy clusters. You may want to set it to
			false under moderate to low write workload when bulk of the reads are
			on the most recently written data.</description>

	<property>
		<name>hbase.regionserver.checksum.verify</name>
		<value>true</value>
		<description>
			If set to true (the default), HBase verifies the checksums for hfile
			blocks. HBase writes checksums inline with the data when it writes out
			hfiles. HDFS (as of this writing) writes checksums to a separate file
			than the data file necessitating extra seeks.  Setting this flag saves
			some on i/o.  Checksum verification by HDFS will be internally disabled
			on hfile streams when this flag is set.  If the hbase-checksum verification
			fails, we will switch back to using HDFS checksums (so do not disable HDFS
			checksums!  And besides this feature applies to hfiles only, not to WALs).
			If this parameter is set to false, then hbase will not verify any checksums,
			instead it will depend on checksum verification being done in the HDFS client.

		<description>
			A comma-separated list of regular expressions used to match against an HTTP
			request's User-Agent header when protection against cross-site request
			forgery (CSRF) is enabled for REST server by setting
			hbase.rest.csrf.enabled to true.  If the incoming User-Agent matches
			any of these regular expressions, then the request is considered to be sent
			by a browser, and therefore CSRF prevention is enforced.  If the request's
			User-Agent does not match any of these regular expressions, then the request
			is considered to be sent by something other than a browser, such as scripted
			automation.  In this case, CSRF is not a potential attack vector, so
			the prevention is not enforced.  This helps achieve backwards-compatibility
			with existing automation that has not been updated to send the CSRF
			prevention header.

		<description>
			The period (in milliseconds) for refreshing the store files for the secondary regions. 0
			means this feature is disabled. Secondary regions sees new files (from flushes and

		<description>
			A comma separated list of class names. Each class in the list must extend
			org.apache.hadoop.hbase.http.FilterInitializer. The corresponding Filter will
			be initialized. Then, the Filter will be applied to all user facing jsp

		<value>org.apache.flink.hbase.shaded.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.codec.KeyValueCodecWithTags</value>
		<description>
			The codec that is to be used when replication is enabled so that
			the tags are also replicated. This is used along with HFileV3 which
			supports tags in them.  If tags are not used or if the hfile version used
			is HFileV2 then KeyValueCodec can be used as the replication codec. Note that
			using KeyValueCodecWithTags for replication when there are no tags causes no harm.
