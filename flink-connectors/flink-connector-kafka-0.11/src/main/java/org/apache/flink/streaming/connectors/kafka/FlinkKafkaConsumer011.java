/**
 * The Flink Kafka Consumer is a streaming data source that pulls a parallel data stream from
 * Apache Kafka 0.11.x. The consumer can run in multiple parallel instances, each of which will pull
 * data from one or more Kafka partitions.
 *
 * <p>The Flink Kafka Consumer participates in checkpointing and guarantees that no data is lost
 * during a failure, and that the computation processes elements "exactly once".
 * (Note: These guarantees naturally assume that Kafka itself does not loose any data.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Please note that Flink snapshots the offsets internally as part of its distributed checkpoints. The offsets
 * committed to Kafka / ZooKeeper are only to bring the outside view of progress in sync with Flink's view
 * of the progress. That way, monitoring and other jobs can get a view of how far the Flink Kafka consumer
 * has consumed a topic.</p>
 *
 * <p>Please refer to Kafka's documentation for the available configuration properties:
 * http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newconsumerconfigs</p>
