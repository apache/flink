/**
 * Elasticsearch 1.x sink that requests multiple {@link ActionRequest ActionRequests}
 * against a cluster for each incoming element.
 *
 * <p>When using the first constructor {@link #ElasticsearchSink(java.util.Map, ElasticsearchSinkFunction)}
 * the sink will create a local {@link Node} for communicating with the Elasticsearch cluster. When using the second
 * constructor {@link #ElasticsearchSink(java.util.Map, java.util.List, ElasticsearchSinkFunction)} a
 * {@link TransportClient} will be used instead.
 *
 * <p><b>Attention: </b> When using the {@code TransportClient} the sink will fail if no cluster
 * can be connected to. When using the local {@code Node} for communicating, the sink will block and wait for a cluster
 * to come online.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Map} passed to the constructor is used to create the {@link Node} or {@link TransportClient}. The config
 * keys can be found in the <a href="https://www.elastic.io">Elasticsearch documentation</a>. An important setting is
 * {@code cluster.name}, which should be set to the name of the cluster that the sink should emit to.
 *
 * <p>Internally, the sink will use a {@link BulkProcessor} to send {@link ActionRequest ActionRequests}.
 * This will buffer elements before sending a request to the cluster. The behaviour of the
 * {@code BulkProcessor} can be configured using these config keys:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> {@code bulk.flush.max.actions}: Maximum amount of elements to buffer
 *   <li> {@code bulk.flush.max.size.mb}: Maximum amount of data (in megabytes) to buffer
 *   <li> {@code bulk.flush.interval.ms}: Interval at which to flush data regardless of the other two
 *   settings in milliseconds
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You also have to provide an {@link ElasticsearchSinkFunction}. This is used to create multiple
 * {@link ActionRequest ActionRequests} for each incoming element. See the class level documentation of
 * {@link ElasticsearchSinkFunction} for an example.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the elements handled by this sink
