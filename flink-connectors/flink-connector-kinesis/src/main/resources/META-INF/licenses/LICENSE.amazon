2.2 Patent Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer its Work, in whole or in part. The foregoing license applies only to the patent claims licensable by Licensor that would be infringed by Licensor’s Work (or portion thereof) individually and excluding any combinations with any other materials or technology.
