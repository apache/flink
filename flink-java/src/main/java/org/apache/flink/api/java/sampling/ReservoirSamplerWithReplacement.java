/**
 * A simple in memory implementation of Reservoir Sampling with replacement and with only one pass
 * through the input iteration whose size is unpredictable. The basic idea behind this sampler
 * implementation is quite similar to {@link ReservoirSamplerWithoutReplacement}. The main
 * difference is that, in the first phase, we generate weights for each element K times, so that
 * each element can get selected multiple times.
 *
 * This implementation refers to the algorithm described in <a href="researcher.ibm.com/files/us-dpwoodru/tw11.pdf">
 * "Optimal Random Sampling from Distributed Streams Revisited"</a>.
