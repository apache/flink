/**
 * A DeltaIteration is similar to a {@link BulkIteration}, 
 * but maintains state across the individual iteration steps. The state is called the <i>solution set</i>, can be obtained
 * via {@link #getSolutionSet()}, and be accessed by joining (or CoGrouping) with it. The solution
 * set is updated by producing a delta for it, which is merged into the solution set at the end of each iteration step.
 * <p>
 * The delta iteration must be closed by setting a delta for the solution set ({@link #setSolutionSetDelta(org.apache.flink.api.common.operators.Operator)})
 * and the new workset (the data set that will be fed back, {@link #setNextWorkset(org.apache.flink.api.common.operators.Operator)}).
 * The DeltaIteration itself represents the result after the iteration has terminated.
 * Delta iterations terminate when the feed back data set (the workset) is empty.
 * In addition, a maximum number of steps is given as a fall back termination guard.
 * <p>
 * Elements in the solution set are uniquely identified by a key. When merging the solution set delta, contained elements
 * with the same key are replaced.
 * <p>
 * This class is a subclass of {@code DualInputOperator}. The solution set is considered the first input, the
 * workset is considered the second input.
