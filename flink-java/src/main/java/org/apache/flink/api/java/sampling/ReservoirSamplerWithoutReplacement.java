/**
 * A simple in memory implementation of Reservoir Sampling without replacement, and with only one
 * pass through the input iteration whose size is unpredictable. The basic idea behind this sampler
 * implementation is to generate a random number for each input element as its weight, select the
 * top K elements with max weight. As the weights are generated randomly, so are the selected
 * top K elements. The algorithm is implemented using the {@link DistributedRandomSampler}
 * interface. In the first phase, we generate random numbers as the weights for each element and
 * select top K elements as the output of each partitions. In the second phase, we select top K
 * elements from all the outputs of the first phase.
 *
 * This implementation refers to the algorithm described in <a href="researcher.ibm.com/files/us-dpwoodru/tw11.pdf">
 * "Optimal Random Sampling from Distributed Streams Revisited"</a>.

 * @param <T> The type of the sampler.
