/**
 * This class defines the PACT annotations, realized as java annotations. To use
 * a PACT annotation, simply add the annotation above the class declaration of
 * the class that realized the user function. For example, to declare the <i>ConstantFieldsExcept</i> 
 * annotation for a map-type function that realizes a simple absolute function,
 * use it the following way:
 * 
 * <pre><blockquote>
 * \@ConstantFieldsExcept(fields={2})
 * public class MyMapper extends MapFunction
 * {
 *     public void map(Record record, Collector out)
 *     {
 *        int value = record.getField(2, IntValue.class).getValue();
		  record.setField(2, new IntValue(Math.abs(value)));
		  
		  out.collect(record);
 *     }
 * }
 * </blockquote></pre>
 * 
 * Be aware that some annotations should only be used for stubs with as single input 
 * ({@link MapFunction}, {@link ReduceFunction}) and some only for stubs with two inputs 
 * ({@link CrossFunction}, {@link JoinFunction}, {@link CoGroupFunction}).
