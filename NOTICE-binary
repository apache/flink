Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
You offer.

the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by the license
steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You
want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use
a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove

license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights
granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the
Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such
60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 

6.3. In
the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses
that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
termination.

NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as
that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer
software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
that addresses Government rights in computer software under this

This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
otherwise make available any Covered Software.

or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You
must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
published by the license steward.
4.3. Modified Versions.
When You are an
Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a)
rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward
(except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS
LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
survive.
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
“Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to
You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
agreement with Participant.
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim
against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then
the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
payment or license.
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

The Covered
Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
(Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is
defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software
documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
(or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
effective on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the
Modifications available to a third party.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b)
above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has

of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of
the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed
by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that
Contributor. 

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source
Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

3.2.
Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must
include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under
the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You
may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1.
New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may

Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this
License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by the license
steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You
want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use
a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the
Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such
60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 

6.3. In
the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses
that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
(or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a
timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the
recipient; and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in
the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided
that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered
Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work
governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally
distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s),
so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further
distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such
Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except
that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known
factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order,
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the
rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated
(a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally
terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails
to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a
particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first
time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the
notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors
for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence
to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

    License

    THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
    COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
    COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

    BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
    TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
    BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
    CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
    CONDITIONS.

    1. Definitions

     a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
        other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
        derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
        literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
        cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
        recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
        derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
        Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
        this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
     b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
        broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
        in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
        arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
        which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
        with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
        independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
        collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
        considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
        License.
     c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
        copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
        other transfer of ownership.
     d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
     e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
        the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
        or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
        addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
        musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
        play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
        expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
        being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
        performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
        organization that transmits the broadcast.
     f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
        of this License including without limitation any production in the
        literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
        form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
        pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
        of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
        choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
        composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
        assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
        a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
        lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
        expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
        art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
        relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
        performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
        extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
        a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
        considered a literary or artistic work.
     g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
        License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
        respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
        Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
        violation.
     h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
        to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
        process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
        performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
        members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
        place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
        by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
        performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
        broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
        sounds or images.
     i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
        without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
        fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
        protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
        medium.

    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
        Collections;
     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
        clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
        to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
        original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
        modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
        in Collections; and,
     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
            reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
            exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
            exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
            of the rights granted under this License; and,
       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
            Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
            voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
            by You of the rights granted under this License.

    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
    other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
    granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
    subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
        of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
        Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
        on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
        the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
        recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
        Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
        Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
        Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
        the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
        incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
        apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
        License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
        must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
        as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
        Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
        practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
        Section 4(b), as requested.
     b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
        Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
        provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
        name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
        and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
        or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
        attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
        terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
        or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
        extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
        refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
        and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
        "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
        based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
        this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
        provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
        a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
        authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
        credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
        other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
        in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
        License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
        connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
        use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
        permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
        Parties.
     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
        Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
        take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
        prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
        agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
        of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
        make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
        modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
        Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
        as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
        right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
        but not otherwise.

    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
        Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
        from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
        terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
        survive any termination of this License.
     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
        Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
        any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
        withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
        required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
        License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
        stated above.

    8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
        the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
        the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
        by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
        the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
        enforceable.
     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
        breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
        and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
        agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
        here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
        may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
        modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
        for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
        September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
        Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
        and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
        These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
        jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
        according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
        those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
        standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
        includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
        additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
        License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
        applicable law.
