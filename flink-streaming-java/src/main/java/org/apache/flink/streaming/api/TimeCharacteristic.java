	 * Ingestion time is often a good compromise between processing time and event time.
	 * It does not need and special manual form of watermark generation, and events are typically
	 * not too much out-or-order when they arrive at operators; in fact, out-of-orderness can 
	 * only be introduced by streaming shuffles or split/join/union operations. The fact that elements

	IngestionTime,

	/**
	 * Event time means that the time of each individual element in the stream (also called event)
	 * is determined by the event's individual custom timestamp. These timestamps either exist in the
	 * elements from before they entered the Flink streaming dataflow, or are user-assigned at the sources.
	 * The big implication of this is that elements arrive in the sources and in all operators generally
	 * out of order, meaning that elements with earlier timestamps may arrive after elements with
	 * later timestamps.
	 * <p>
	 * Operators that window or order data with respect to event time must buffer data until they can
	 * be sure that all timestamps for a certain time interval have been received. This is handled by
	 * the so called "time watermarks".
	 * <p>
	 * Operations based on event time are very predictable - the result of windowing operations
	 * is typically identical no matter when the window is executed and how fast the streams operate.
	 * At the same time, the buffering and tracking of event time is also costlier than operating
	 * with processing time, and typically also introduces more latency. The amount of extra
	 * cost depends mostly on how much out of order the elements arrive, i.e., how long the time span
	 * between the arrival of early and late elements is. With respect to the "time watermarks", this
	 * means that the cost typically depends on how early or late the watermarks can be generated
	 * for their timestamp.
	 * <p>
	 * In relation to {@link #IngestionTime}, the event time is similar, but refers the the event's
	 * original time, rather than the time assigned at the data source. Practically, that means that
	 * event time has generally more meaning, but also that it takes longer to determine that all
	 * elements for a certain time have arrived.
