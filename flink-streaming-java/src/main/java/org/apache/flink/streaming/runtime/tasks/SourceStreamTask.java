/**
 * Task for executing streaming sources.

 * One important aspect of this is that the checkpointing and the emission of elements must never
 * occur at the same time. The execution must be serial. This is achieved by having the contract
 * with the StreamFunction that it must only modify its state or emit elements in
 * a synchronized block that locks on the lock Object. Also, the modification of the state
 * and the emission of elements must happen in the same block of code that is protected by the
 * synchronized block.
 *
 * @param <OUT> Type of the output elements of this source.
 * @param <SRC> Type of the source function for the stream source operator
 * @param <OP> Type of the stream source operator
