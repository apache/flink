/**
 * This method must be implemented by functions that have state that needs to be
 * checkpointed. The functions get a call whenever a checkpoint should take place
 * and return a snapshot of their state, which will be checkpointed.
 *
 * <h1>Deprecation and Replacement</h1>
 * The short cut replacement for this interface is via {@link ListCheckpointed} and works
 * as shown in the example below. The {@code ListCheckpointed} interface returns a list of
 * elements (
 *
 * <p><pre>{@code
 * public class ExampleFunction<T> implements MapFunction<T, T>, ListCheckpointed<Integer> {
 *
 *     private int count;
 *
 *     public List<Integer> snapshotState(long checkpointId, long timestamp) throws Exception {
 *         return Collections.singletonList(this.count);
 *     }
 *
 *     public void restoreState(List<Integer> state) throws Exception {
 *         this.value = state.count.isEmpty() ? 0 : state.get(0);
 *     }
 *
 *     public T map(T value) {
 *         count++;
 *         return value;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the operator state.
 *
 * @deprecated Please use {@link ListCheckpointed} as illustrated above, or
 *             {@link CheckpointedFunction} for more control over the checkpointing process.
