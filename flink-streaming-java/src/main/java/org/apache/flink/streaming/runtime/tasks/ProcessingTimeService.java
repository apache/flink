 *         return a "dummy" future as a result. This is used for clean shutdown, where currently firing
 *         timers are waited for and no future timers can be scheduled, without causing hard exceptions.</li>
 *     <li>After a call to {@link #shutdownService()}, all calls to {@link #registerTimer(long, ProcessingTimeCallback)}
