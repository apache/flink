/**
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} like interface for an  build around a mailbox-based execution model (see {@link TaskMailbox}).
 * {@code MailboxExecutor} can also execute downstream messages of a mailbox by yielding control from the task thread.
 *
 * <p>All submission functions can be called from any thread and will enqueue the action for further processing in a
 * FIFO fashion.
 *
 * <p>The yielding functions avoid the following situation: One operator cannot fully process an input record and
 * blocks the task thread until some resources are available. However, since the introduction of the mailbox model
 * blocking the task thread will not only block new inputs but also all events from being processed. If the resources
 * depend on downstream operators being able to process such events (e.g., timers), then we may easily arrive at some
 * livelocks.
 *
 * <p>The yielding functions will only process events from the operator itself and any downstream operator. Events of upstream
 * operators are only processed when the input has been fully processed or if they yield themselves. This method avoid
 * congestion and potential deadlocks, but will process {@link Mail}s slightly out-of-order, effectively creating a view
 * on the mailbox that contains no message from upstream operators.
 *
 * <p><b>All yielding functions must be called in the mailbox thread</b> (see {@link TaskMailbox#isMailboxThread()}) to not
 * violate the single-threaded execution model. There are two typical cases, both waiting until the resource is
 * available. The main difference is if the resource becomes available through a mailbox message itself or not.
 *
 * <p>If the resource becomes available through a mailbox mail, we can effectively block the task thread.
 * Implicitly, this requires the mail to be enqueued by a different thread.
 * <pre>{@code
 * while (resource not available) {
 *     mailboxExecutor.yield();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>If the resource becomes available through an external mechanism or the corresponding mail needs to be enqueued
 * in the task thread, we cannot block.
 * <pre>{@code
 * while (resource not available) {
 *     if (!mailboxExecutor.tryYield()) {
 *         do stuff or sleep for a small amount of time
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
