/**
 * This is a special window assigner used to tell the system to use the
 * <i>"Fast Aligned Processing Time Window Operator"</i> for windowing.
 *
 * <p>Prior Flink versions used that operator automatically for simple processing time
 * windows (tumbling and sliding) when no custom trigger and no evictor was specified.
 * In the current Flink version, that operator is only used when programs explicitly
 * specify this window assigner. This is only intended for special cases where programs relied on
 * the better performance of the fast aligned window operator, and are willing to accept the lack
 * of support for various features as indicated below:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>No custom state backend can be selected, the operator always stores data on the Java heap.</li>
 *     <li>The operator does not support key groups, meaning it cannot change the parallelism.</li>
 *     <li>Future versions of Flink may not be able to resume from checkpoints/savepoints taken by this
 *         operator.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Future implementation plans: We plan to add some of the optimizations used by this operator to
 * the general window operator, so that future versions of Flink will not have the performance/functionality
 * trade-off any more.
 *
 * <p>Note on implementation: The concrete operator instantiated by this assigner is either the
 * {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.operators.windowing.AggregatingProcessingTimeWindowOperator}
 * or {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.operators.windowing.AccumulatingProcessingTimeWindowOperator}.
