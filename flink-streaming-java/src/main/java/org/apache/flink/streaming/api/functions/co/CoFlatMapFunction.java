/**
 * A CoFlatMapFunction implements a flat-map transformation over two
 * connected streams.
 *
 * <p>The same instance of the transformation function is used to transform
 * both of the connected streams. That way, the stream transformations can
 * share state.
 *
 * <p>An example for the use of connected streams would be to apply rules that change over time
 * onto elements of a stream. One of the connected streams has the rules, the other stream the
 * elements to apply the rules to. The operation on the connected stream maintains the
 * current set of rules in the state. It may receive either a rule update (from the first stream)
 * and update the state, or a data element (from the second stream) and apply the rules in the
 * state to the element. The result of applying the rules would be emitted.
 *
 * @param <IN1> Type of the first input.
 * @param <IN2> Type of the second input.
 * @param <OUT> Output type.
