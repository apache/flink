/**
 * Base class for implementing a parallel event-time data source that has access to context information
 * (via {@link #getRuntimeContext()}) and additional life-cycle methods
 * ({@link #open(org.apache.flink.configuration.Configuration)} and {@link #close()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is useful when implementing parallel sources where different parallel subtasks
 * need to perform different work. Typical patterns for that are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Use {@link #getRuntimeContext()} to obtain the runtime context.</li>
 *     <li>Use {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RuntimeContext#getNumberOfParallelSubtasks()}
 *         to determine the current parallelism. It is strongly encouraged to use this method, rather than
 *         hard-wiring the parallelism, because the configured parallelism may change depending on
 *         program configuration. The parallelism may also change after recovering failures, when fewer than
 *         desired parallel worker as available.</li>
 *     <li>Use {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RuntimeContext#getIndexOfThisSubtask()} to
 *         determine which subtask the current instance of the function executes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * @param <OUT> The type of the records produced by this source.
