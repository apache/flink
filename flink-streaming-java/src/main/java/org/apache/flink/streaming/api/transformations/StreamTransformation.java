/**
 * A {@code StreamTransformation} represents the operation that creates a
 * {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream}. Every
 * {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream} has an underlying
 * {@code StreamTransformation} that is the origin of said DataStream.
 *
 * <p>
 * API operations such as {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream#map} create
 * a tree of {@code StreamTransformation}s underneath. When the stream program is to be executed this
 * graph is translated to a {@link StreamGraph} using
 * {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.graph.StreamGraphGenerator}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code StreamTransformation} does not necessarily correspond to a physical operation
 * at runtime. Some operations are only logical concepts. Examples of this are union,
 * split/select data stream, partitioning.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following graph of {@code StreamTransformations}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   Source              Source        
 *      +                   +
