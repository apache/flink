/**
 * A function that processes elements of two streams and produces a single output one.
 *
 * <p>The function will be called for every element in the input streams and can produce
 * zero or more output elements. Contrary to the {@link CoFlatMapFunction}, this function can also
 * query the time (both event and processing) and set timers, through the provided {@link Context}.
 * When reacting to the firing of set timers the function can emit yet more elements.
 *
 * <p>An example use-case for connected streams would be the application of a set of rules that change
 * over time ({@code stream A}) to the elements contained in another stream (stream {@code B}). The rules
 * contained in {@code stream A} can be stored in the state and wait for new elements to arrive on
 * {@code stream B}. Upon reception of a new element on {@code stream B}, the function can now apply the
 * previously stored rules to the element and directly emit a result, and/or register a timer that
 * will trigger an action in the future.
 *
 * @param <IN1> Type of the first input.
 * @param <IN2> Type of the second input.
 * @param <OUT> Output type.
