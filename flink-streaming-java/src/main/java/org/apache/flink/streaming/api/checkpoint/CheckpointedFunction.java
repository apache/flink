/**
 * This is the core interface for <i>stateful transformation functions</i>, meaning functions
 * that maintain state across individual stream records.
 * While more lightweight interfaces exist as shortcuts for various types of state, this interface offer the
 * greatest flexibility in managing both <i>keyed state</i> and <i>operator state</i>.
 *
 * <p>The section <a href="#shortcuts">Shortcuts</a> illustrates the common lightweight
 * ways to setup stateful functions typically used instead of the full fledged
 * abstraction represented by this interface.
 *
 * <h1>Initialization</h1>
 *
 * <p>The {@link CheckpointedFunction#initializeState(FunctionInitializationContext)} is called when
 * the parallel instance of the transformation function is created during distributed execution.
 * The method gives access to the {@link FunctionInitializationContext} which in turn gives access
 * to the to the {@link OperatorStateStore} and {@link KeyedStateStore}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code OperatorStateStore} and {@code KeyedStateStore} give access to the data structures
 * in which state should be stored for Flink to transparently manage and checkpoint it, such as
 * {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.state.ValueState} or
 * {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.state.ListState}.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The {@code KeyedStateStore} can only be used when the transformation supports
 * <i>keyed state</i>, i.e., when it is applied on a keyed stream (after a {@code keyBy(...)}).
 *
 * <h1>Snapshot</h1>
 *
 * <p>The {@link CheckpointedFunction#snapshotState(FunctionSnapshotContext)} is called whenever a
 * checkpoint takes a state snapshot of the transformation function. Inside this method, functions typically
 * make sure that the checkpointed data structures (obtained in the initialization phase) are up
 * to date for a snapshot to be taken. The given snapshot context gives access to the metadata
 * of the checkpoint.
 *
 * <p>In addition, functions can use this method as a hook to flush/commit/synchronize with
 * external systems.
 *
 * <h1>Example</h1>
 *
 * <p>The code example below illustrates how to use this interface for a function that keeps counts
 * of events per key and per parallel partition (parallel instance of the transformation function
 * during distributed execution).
 * The example also changes of parallelism, which affect the count-per-parallel-partition by
 * adding up the counters of partitions that get merged on scale-down. Note that this is a
 * toy example, but should illustrate the basic skeleton for a stateful function.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyFunction<T> implements MapFunction<T, T>, CheckpointedFunction {
 *
 *     private ReducingState<Long> countPerKey;
 *     private ListState<Long> countPerPartition;
 *
 *     private long localCount;
 *
 *     public void initializeState(FunctionInitializationContext context) throws Exception {
 *         // get the state data structure for the per-key state
 *         countPerKey = context.getKeyedStateStore().getReducingState(
 *                 new ReducingStateDescriptor<>("perKeyCount", new AddFunction<>(), Long.class));
 *
 *         // get the state data structure for the per-partition state
 *         countPerPartition = context.getOperatorStateStore().getOperatorState(
 *                 new ListStateDescriptor<>("perPartitionCount", Long.class));
 *
 *         // initialize the "local count variable" based on the operator state
 *         for (Long l : countPerPartition.get()) {
 *             localCount += l;
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     public void snapshotState(FunctionSnapshotContext context) throws Exception {
 *         // the keyed state is always up to date anyways
 *         // just bring the per-partition state in shape
 *         countPerPartition.clear();
 *         countPerPartition.add(localCount);
 *     }
 *
 *     public T map(T value) throws Exception {
 *         // update the states
 *         countPerKey.add(1L);
 *         localCount++;
 *
 *         return value;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * <h1><a name="shortcuts">Shortcuts</a></h1>
 *
 * <p>There are various ways that transformation functions can use state without implementing the
 * full-fledged {@code CheckpointedFunction} interface:
 *
 * <h4>Operator State</h4>
 *
 * <p>Checkpointing some state that is part of the function object itself is possible in a simpler way
 * by directly implementing the {@link ListCheckpointed} interface.
 *
 * <h4>Keyed State</h4>
 *
 * <p>Access to keyed state is possible via the {@link RuntimeContext}'s methods:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class CountPerKeyFunction<T> extends RichMapFunction<T, T> {
 *
 *     private ValueState<Long> count;
 *
 *     public void open(Configuration cfg) throws Exception {
 *         count = getRuntimeContext().getState(new ValueStateDescriptor<>("myCount", Long.class));
 *     }
 *
 *     public T map(T value) throws Exception {
 *         Long current = count.get();
 *         count.update(current == null ? 1L : current + 1);
 *
 *         return value;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
