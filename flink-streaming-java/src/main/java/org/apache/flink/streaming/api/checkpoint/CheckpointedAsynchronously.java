/**
 * This interface marks a function/operator as checkpointed similar to the
 * {@link Checkpointed} interface, but gives the Flink framework the option to
 * perform the checkpoint asynchronously. Note that asynchronous checkpointing for
 * this interface has not been implemented.
 *
 * <h1>Deprecation and Replacement</h1>
 * The shortcut replacement for this interface is via {@link ListCheckpointed} and works
 * as shown in the example below. Please refer to the JavaDocs of {@link ListCheckpointed} for
 * a more detailed description of how to use the new interface.
 *
 * <p><pre>{@code
 * public class ExampleFunction<T> implements MapFunction<T, T>, ListCheckpointed<Integer> {
 *
 *     private int count;
 *
 *     public List<Integer> snapshotState(long checkpointId, long timestamp) throws Exception {
 *         return Collections.singletonList(this.count);
 *     }
 *
 *     public void restoreState(List<Integer> state) throws Exception {
 *         this.value = state.isEmpty() ? 0 : state.get(0);
 *     }
 *
 *     public T map(T value) {
 *         count++;
 *         return value;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @deprecated Please use {@link ListCheckpointed} and {@link CheckpointedFunction} instead,
 *             as illustrated in the example above.
