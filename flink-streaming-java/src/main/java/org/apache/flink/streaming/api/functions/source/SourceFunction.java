/**
 * Base interface for all stream data sources in Flink. The contract of a stream source
 * is the following: When the source should start emitting elements, the {@link #run} method
 * is called with a {@link SourceContext} that can be used for emitting elements.
 * The run method can run for as long as necessary. The source must, however, react to an
 * invocation of {@link #cancel()} by breaking out of its main loop.
 *
 * <h3>CheckpointedFunction Sources</h3>
 *
 * <p>Sources that also implement the {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.checkpoint.CheckpointedFunction}
 * interface must ensure that state checkpointing, updating of internal state and emission of
 * elements are not done concurrently. This is achieved by using the provided checkpointing lock
 * object to protect update of state and emission of elements in a synchronized block.
 *
 * <p>This is the basic pattern one should follow when implementing a checkpointed source:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *  public class ExampleCountSource implements SourceFunction<Long>, CheckpointedFunction {
 *      private long count = 0L;
 *      private volatile boolean isRunning = true;
 *
 *      private transient ListState<Long> checkpointedCount;
 *
 *      public void run(SourceContext<T> ctx) {
 *          while (isRunning && count < 1000) {
 *              // this synchronized block ensures that state checkpointing,
 *              // internal state updates and emission of elements are an atomic operation
 *              synchronized (ctx.getCheckpointLock()) {
 *                  ctx.collect(count);
 *                  count++;
 *              }
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      public void cancel() {
 *          isRunning = false;
 *      }
 *
 *      public void initializeState(FunctionInitializationContext context) {
 *          this.checkpointedCount = context
 *              .getOperatorStateStore()
 *              .getListState(new ListStateDescriptor<>("count", Long.class));
 *
 *          if (context.isRestored()) {
 *              for (Long count : this.checkpointedCount.get()) {
 *                  this.count = count;
 *              }
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      public void snapshotState(FunctionSnapshotContext context) {
 *          this.checkpointedCount.clear();
 *          this.checkpointedCount.add(count);
 *      }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Timestamps and watermarks:</h3>
 * Sources may assign timestamps to elements and may manually emit watermarks.
 * However, these are only interpreted if the streaming program runs on
 * {@link TimeCharacteristic#EventTime}. On other time characteristics
 * ({@link TimeCharacteristic#IngestionTime} and {@link TimeCharacteristic#ProcessingTime}),
 * the watermarks from the source function are ignored.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the elements produced by this source.
