/**
 * A common timer service interface with life cycle methods.
 *
 * <p>The registration of timers follows a life cycle of three phases:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>In the initial state, it accepts timer registrations and triggers when the time is reached.</li>
 *     <li>After calling {@link #quiesce()}, further calls to
 *         {@link #registerTimer(long, ProcessingTimeCallback)} will not register any further timers, and will
 *         return a "dummy" future as a result. This is used for clean shutdown, where currently firing
 *         timers are waited for and no future timers can be scheduled, without causing hard exceptions.</li>
 *     <li>After a call to {@link #shutdownService()}, all calls to {@link #registerTimer(long, ProcessingTimeCallback)}
 *         will result in a hard exception.</li>
 * </ol>
