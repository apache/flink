 * is invoked. This can produce zero or more elements as output. Implementations can also
 * query the time and set timers through the provided {@link Context}. For firing timers
 * {@link #onTimer(long, OnTimerContext, Collector)} will be invoked. This can again produce
 * zero or more elements as output and register further timers.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Access to keyed state and timers (which are also scoped to a key) is only
 * available if the {@code ProcessFunction} is applied on a {@code KeyedStream}.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> A {@code ProcessFunction} is always a
 * {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RichFunction}. Therefore, access to the
 * {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RuntimeContext} is always available and setup and
 * teardown methods can be implemented. See
