/**
 * Partitioner that distributes the data equally by cycling through the output
 * channels. This distributes only to a subset of downstream nodes because
 * {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.graph.StreamingJobGraphGenerator} instantiates
 * a {@link DistributionPattern#POINTWISE} distribution pattern when encountering
 * {@code SemiRebalancePartitioner}.
 *
 * <p>The subset of downstream operations to which the upstream operation sends
 * elements depends on the degree of parallelism of both the upstream and downstream operation.
 * For example, if the upstream operation has parallelism 2 and the downstream operation
 * has parallelism 4, then one upstream operation would distribute elements to two
 * downstream operations while the other upstream operation would distribute to the other
 * two downstream operations. If, on the other hand, the downstream operation has parallelism
 * 2 while the upstream operation has parallelism 4 then two upstream operations will
 * distribute to one downstream operation while the other two upstream operations will
 * distribute to the other downstream operations.
 *
 * <p>In cases where the different parallelisms are not multiples of each other one or several
 * downstream operations will have a differing number of inputs from upstream operations.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the elements in the Stream being rescaled
