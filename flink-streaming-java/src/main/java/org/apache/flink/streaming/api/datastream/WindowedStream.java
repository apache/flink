 * A {@code WindowedStream} represents a data stream where elements are grouped by key, and for each
 * key, the stream of elements is split into windows based on a {@link
 * org.apache.flink.streaming.api.windowing.assigners.WindowAssigner}. Window emission is triggered
 * based on a {@link org.apache.flink.streaming.api.windowing.triggers.Trigger}.
 *
 * <p>The windows are conceptually evaluated for each key individually, meaning windows can trigger
 * at different points for each key.
 *
 * <p>If an {@link Evictor} is specified it will be used to evict elements from the window after
 * evaluation was triggered by the {@code Trigger} but before the actual evaluation of the window.
 * When using an evictor window performance will degrade significantly, since incremental
 * aggregation of window results cannot be used.
 *
 * <p>Note that the {@code WindowedStream} is purely an API construct, during runtime the {@code
 * WindowedStream} will be collapsed together with the {@code KeyedStream} and the operation over
 * the window into one single operation.
