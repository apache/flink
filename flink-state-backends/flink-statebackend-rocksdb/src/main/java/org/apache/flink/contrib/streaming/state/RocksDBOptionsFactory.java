 * A factory for {@link DBOptions} and {@link ColumnFamilyOptions} to be passed to the {@link RocksDBStateBackend}.
 * Options have to be created lazily by this factory, because the {@code Options}
 * class is not serializable and holds pointers to native code.
 *
 * <p>A typical pattern to use this OptionsFactory is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * rocksDbBackend.setRocksDBOptions(new RocksDBOptionsFactory() {
 *
 *		public DBOptions createDBOptions(DBOptions currentOptions, Collection<AutoCloseable> handlesToClose) {
 *			return currentOptions.setMaxOpenFiles(1024);
 *		}
 *
 *		public ColumnFamilyOptions createColumnOptions(ColumnFamilyOptions currentOptions, Collection<AutoCloseable> handlesToClose) {
 *			BloomFilter bloomFilter = new BloomFilter();
 * 			handlesToClose.add(bloomFilter);
 *
 * 			return currentOptions
 * 					.setTableFormatConfig(
 * 							new BlockBasedTableConfig().setFilter(bloomFilter));
 *		}
 * });
