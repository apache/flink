 * 
 * <h3>Java 8:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * rocksDbBackend.setOptions( (currentOptions) -> currentOptions.setMaxOpenFiles(1024) );
 * }</pre>
 *

 * <pre>{@code
 * rocksDbBackend.setOptions(new OptionsFactory() {
 *     
 *     public Options setOptions(Options currentOptions) {
 *         return currentOptions.setMaxOpenFiles(1024);
 *     }
 * })
