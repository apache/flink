/**
 * A MeterView provides an average rate of events per second over a given time period.
 * 
 * The primary advantage of this class is that the rate is neither updated by the computing thread nor for every event.
 * Instead, a history of counts is maintained that is updated in regular intervals by a background thread. From this
 * history a rate is derived on demand, which represents the average rate of events over the given time span.
 * 
 * Setting the time span to a low value reduces memory-consumption and will more accurately report short-term changes.
 * The minimum value possible is {@link View#UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS}.
 * A high value in turn increases memory-consumption, since a longer history has to be maintained, but will result in
 * smoother transitions between rates.
 * 
 * The events are counted by a {@link Counter}.
