# This file defines an Azure Pipeline build for testing Flink. It is intended to be used
# with a free Azure Pipelines account.
# It has the following features:
#  - default builds for pushes / pull requests
#  - end-to-end tests
#
#
# For the "apache/flink" repository, we are using the pipeline definition located in
#   tools/azure-pipelines/build-apache-repo.yml
# That file points to custom, self-hosted build agents for faster pull request build processing and 
# integration with Flinkbot.
# The custom pipeline definition file is configured in the "Pipeline settings" screen
# of the Azure Pipelines web ui.
