# Apache Flink

Apache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities.

Learn more about Flink at [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)


### Features

* A streaming-first runtime that supports both batch processing and data streaming programs

* Elegant and fluent APIs in Java and Scala

* A runtime that supports very high throughput and low event latency at the same time

* Support for *event time* and *out-of-order* processing in the DataStream API, based on the *Dataflow Model*

* Flexible windowing (time, count, sessions, custom triggers) across different time semantics (event time, processing time)

* Fault-tolerance with *exactly-once* processing guarantees

* Natural back-pressure in streaming programs

* Libraries for Graph processing (batch), Machine Learning (batch), and Complex Event Processing (streaming)

* Built-in support for iterative programs (BSP) in the DataSet (batch) API

* Custom memory management for efficient and robust switching between in-memory and out-of-core data processing algorithms

* Compatibility layers for Apache Hadoop MapReduce

* Integration with YARN, HDFS, HBase, and other components of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem


### Streaming Example
```scala
case class WordWithCount(word: String, count: Long)

val text = env.socketTextStream(host, port, '\n')

val windowCounts = text.flatMap { w => w.split("\\s") }
  .map { w => WordWithCount(w, 1) }
  .keyBy("word")
  .timeWindow(Time.seconds(5))
  .sum("count")

windowCounts.print()
```

### Batch Example
```scala
case class WordWithCount(word: String, count: Long)

val text = env.readTextFile(path)

val counts = text.flatMap { w => w.split("\\s") }
  .map { w => WordWithCount(w, 1) }
  .groupBy("word")
  .sum("count")

counts.writeAsCsv(outputPath)
```



## Building Apache Flink from Source

Prerequisites for building Flink:

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin)
* git
* Maven (we recommend version 3.2.5 and require at least 3.1.1)
* Java 8 (Java 9 and 10 are not yet supported)

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink.git
cd flink
mvn clean package -DskipTests # this will take up to 10 minutes
```

Flink is now installed in `build-target`

*NOTE: Maven 3.3.x can build Flink, but will not properly shade away certain dependencies. Maven 3.1.1 creates the libraries properly.
To build unit tests with Java 8, use Java 8u51 or above to prevent failures in unit tests that use the PowerMock runner.*

## Developing Flink

The Flink committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Flink codebase.
We recommend IntelliJ IDEA for developing projects that involve Scala code.

Minimal requirements for an IDE are:
* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)
* Support for Maven with Java and Scala


### IntelliJ IDEA

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development.

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)

Check out our [Setting up IntelliJ](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/flinkDev/ide_setup.html#intellij-idea) guide for details.

### Eclipse Scala IDE

**NOTE:** From our experience, this setup does not work with Flink
due to deficiencies of the old Eclipse version bundled with Scala IDE 3.0.3 or
due to version incompatibilities with the bundled Scala version in Scala IDE 4.4.1.

**We recommend to use IntelliJ instead (see above)**
