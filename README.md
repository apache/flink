# Stratosphere

_"Big Data looks tiny from Stratosphere."_

Stratosphere is a next-generation Big Data Analytics Platform. It combines the strengths of MapReduce/Hadoop with powerful programming abstractions in Java and Scala, and a high performance runtime. Stratosphere has native support for iterations, delta iterations, and programs consisting of workflows of many operations.

## Start writing a Stratosphere Job
If you just want to get started with Stratosphere, use the following command to set up an empty Stratosphere Job

```
curl https://raw.github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere-quickstart/master/quickstart.sh | bash
```
The quickstart sample contains everything to develop a Stratosphere Job on your computer and run it in a local embedded runtime. No setup needed.
Further quickstart guides are at http://stratosphere.eu/quickstart/


## Build Stratosphere
Below are three short tutorials that guide you through the first steps: Building, running and developing.

###  Build From Source

This tutorial shows how to build Stratosphere on your own system. Please open a bug report if you have any troubles!

#### Requirements
* Unix-like environment (We use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin)
* git
* Maven (at least version 3.0.4)
* Java 6, 7 or 8 (Note that Oracle's JDK 6 library will fail to build Stratosphere, but is able to run a pre-compiled package without problem)

```
git clone https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere.git
cd stratosphere
mvn -DskipTests clean package # this will take up to 5 minutes
```

Stratosphere is now installed in `stratosphere-dist/target`
If you’re a Debian/Ubuntu user, you’ll find a .deb package. We will continue with the generic case.

	cd stratosphere-dist/target/stratosphere-dist-0.5-SNAPSHOT-bin/stratosphere-0.5-SNAPSHOT/

The directory structure here looks like the contents of the official release distribution.

#### Build for different Hadoop Versions
This section is for advanced users that want to build Stratosphere for a different Hadoop version, for example for Hadoop Yarn support.

We use the profile activation via properties (-D).

##### Build hadoop v1 (default)
Build the default (currently hadoop 1.2.1)
```mvn clean package```

Build for a specific hadoop v1 version
```mvn -Dhadoop-one.version=1.1.2 clean package```

##### Build hadoop v2 (yarn)

Build the yarn using the default version defined in the pom
```mvn -Dhadoop.profile=2 clean package```

Build for a specific hadoop v1 version
```mvn -Dhadoop.profile=2 -Dhadoop-two.version=2.1.0-beta clean package```

It is necessary to generate separate POMs if you want to deploy to your local repository (`mvn install`) or somewhere else.
We have a script in `/tools` that generates POMs for the profiles. Use 
```mvn -f pom.hadoop2.xml clean install -DskipTests```
to put a POM file with the right dependencies into your local repository.


### Run your first program

We will run a simple “Word Count” example. 
The easiest way to start Stratosphere on your local machine is so-called "local-mode":

	./bin/start-local.sh

Get some test data:

	 wget -O hamlet.txt http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1787/pg1787.txt

Start the job:

	./bin/stratosphere run --jarfile ./examples/stratosphere-java-examples-0.5-SNAPSHOT-WordCount.jar --arguments 1 file://`pwd`/hamlet.txt file://`pwd`/wordcount-result.txt

You will find a file called `wordcount-result.txt` in your current directory.

#### Alternative Method: Use the webclient interface
(And get a nice execution plan overview for free!)

	./bin/start-local.sh
	./bin/start-webclient.sh start

Get some test data:
	 wget -O ~/hamlet.txt http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1787/pg1787.txt

* Point your browser to to http://localhost:8080/launch.html. Upload the WordCount.jar using the upload form in the lower right box. The jar is located in `./examples/stratosphere-java-examples-0.5-SNAPSHOT-WordCount.jar`.
* Select the WordCount jar from the list of available jars (upper left).
* Enter the argument line in the lower-left box: `1 file://<path to>/hamlet.txt file://<wherever you want the>/wordcount-result.txt`

* Hit “Run Job”


### Eclipse Setup and Debugging

To contribute back to the project or develop your own jobs for Stratosphere, you need a working development environment. We use Eclipse and IntelliJ for development. Here we focus on Eclipse.

If you want to work on the scala code you will need the following plugins:

Eclipse 4.x:
  * scala-ide: http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e38/scala210/stable/site
  * m2eclipse-scala: http://alchim31.free.fr/m2e-scala/update-site
  * build-helper-maven-plugin: https://repository.sonatype.org/content/repositories/forge-sites/m2e-extras/0.15.0/N/0.15.0.201206251206/

Eclipse 3.7:
  * scala-ide: http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/e37/scala210/stable/site
  * m2eclipse-scala: http://alchim31.free.fr/m2e-scala/update-site
  * build-helper-maven-plugin: https://repository.sonatype.org/content/repositories/forge-sites/m2e-extras/0.14.0/N/0.14.0.201109282148/

When you don't have the plugins your project will have build errors, you can just close the scala projects and ignore them.
o
Import the Stratosphere source code using Maven's Import tool:
  * Select "Import" from the "File"-menu.
  * Expand "Maven" node, select "Existing Maven Projects", and click "next" button
  * Select the root directory by clicking on the "Browse" button and navigate to the top folder of the cloned Stratosphere Git repository.
  * Ensure that all projects are selected and click the "Finish" button.

Create a new Eclipse Project that requires Stratosphere in its Build Path!

Use this skeleton as an entry point for your own Jobs: It allows you to hit the “Run as” -> “Java Application” feature of Eclipse:

```java
public class Tutorial implements Program {

    @Override
    public Plan getPlan(String... args) {
        // your parallel program goes here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Tutorial tut = new Tutorial();
        Plan toExecute = tut.getPlan(args);
        long runtime = LocalExecutor.execute(toExecute);
        System.out.println("Runime: " + runtime);
    }
}
```

## About

[Stratosphere](http://www.stratosphere.eu) is a DFG-founded research project.
We combine cutting edge research outcomes with a stable and usable codebase.
Decisions are not made behind closed doors. We discuss all changes and plans on our Mailinglists and on GitHub.


<!--- Commented out Travis until we get a reliable report on build status. Currently, out tests are so heavy that a large portion of our Travis builds get killed for taking too long.
