# Apache Flink (incubating)


Apache Flink is an open source system for expressive, declarative, fast, and efficient data analysis. Flink combines the scalability and programming flexibility of distributed MapReduce-like platforms with the efficiency, out-of-core execution, and query optimization capabilities found in parallel databases.

## Build Apache Flink

###  Build From Source


#### Requirements
* Unix-like environment (We use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin)
* git
* Maven (at least version 3.0.4)
* Java 6, 7 or 8 (Note that Oracle's JDK 6 library will fail to build Flink, but is able to run a pre-compiled package without problem)

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink.git
cd incubator-flink
mvn clean package -DskipTests # this will take up to 5 minutes
```

Flink is now installed in `flink-dist/target`

## About

Apache Flink is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

The Apache Flink project originated from the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu) research project.
