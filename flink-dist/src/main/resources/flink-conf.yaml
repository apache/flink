# Directories for temporary files.
#
# Add a delimited list for multiple directories, using the system directory
# delimiter (colon ':' on unix) or a comma, e.g.:
#     /data1/tmp:/data2/tmp:/data3/tmp
#
# Note: Each directory entry is read from and written to by a different I/O
# thread. You can include the same directory multiple times in order to create
# multiple I/O threads against that directory. This is for example relevant for
# high-throughput RAIDs.
#
# If not specified, the system-specific Java temporary directory (java.io.tmpdir
# property) is taken.

# taskmanager.tmp.dirs: /tmp

# Path to the Hadoop configuration directory.
#
# This configuration is used when writing into HDFS. Unless specified otherwise,
# HDFS file creation will use HDFS default settings with respect to block-size,
# replication factor, etc.
#
# You can also directly specify the paths to hdfs-default.xml and hdfs-site.xml
# via keys 'fs.hdfs.hdfsdefault' and 'fs.hdfs.hdfssite'.
