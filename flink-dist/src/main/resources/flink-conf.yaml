# Common
#==============================================================================

# The external address of the host on which the JobManager runs and can be
# reached by the TaskManagers and any clients which want to connect. This setting
# is only used in Standalone mode and may be overwritten on the JobManager side
# by specifying the --host <hostname> parameter of the bin/jobmanager.sh executable.
# In high availability mode, if you use the bin/start-cluster.sh script and setup
# the conf/masters file, this will be taken care of automatically. Yarn/Mesos
# automatically configure the host name based on the hostname of the node where the
# JobManager runs.

jobmanager.rpc.address: localhost

# The RPC port where the JobManager is reachable.

jobmanager.rpc.port: 6123


# The heap size for the JobManager JVM

jobmanager.heap.mb: 256


# The heap size for the TaskManager JVM

taskmanager.heap.mb: 512


# The number of task slots that each TaskManager offers. Each slot runs one parallel pipeline.

taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 1

# Specify whether TaskManager memory should be allocated when starting up (true) or when
# memory is required in the memory manager (false)

taskmanager.memory.preallocate: false

# The parallelism used for programs that did not specify and other parallelism.

parallelism.default: 1


#==============================================================================
# Web Frontend
#==============================================================================
 
# The address under which the web-based runtime monitor listens.
#
#jobmanager.web.address: 0.0.0.0

# The port under which the web-based runtime monitor listens.
# A value of -1 deactivates the web server.

jobmanager.web.port: 8081

# Flag to specify whether job submission is enabled from the web-based
# runtime monitor. Uncomment to disable.

#jobmanager.web.submit.enable: false


#==============================================================================
# Streaming state checkpointing
#==============================================================================

# The backend that will be used to store operator state checkpoints if
# checkpointing is enabled.
#
# Supported backends: jobmanager, filesystem, rocksdb, <class-name-of-factory>
#
#state.backend: filesystem


# Directory for storing checkpoints in a Flink-supported filesystem
# Note: State backend must be accessible from the JobManager and all TaskManagers.
# Use "hdfs://" for HDFS setups, "file://" for UNIX/POSIX-compliant file systems,
# (or any local file system under Windows), or "S3://" for S3 file system.
#
# state.backend.fs.checkpointdir: hdfs://namenode-host:port/flink-checkpoints


#==============================================================================
# Advanced
#==============================================================================

# The number of buffers for the network stack.
#
# taskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers: 2048


# Directories for temporary files.
#
# Add a delimited list for multiple directories, using the system directory
# delimiter (colon ':' on unix) or a comma, e.g.:
#     /data1/tmp:/data2/tmp:/data3/tmp
#
# Note: Each directory entry is read from and written to by a different I/O
# thread. You can include the same directory multiple times in order to create
# multiple I/O threads against that directory. This is for example relevant for
# high-throughput RAIDs.
#
# If not specified, the system-specific Java temporary directory (java.io.tmpdir
# property) is taken.
#
# taskmanager.tmp.dirs: /tmp


# Path to the Hadoop configuration directory.
#
# This configuration is used when writing into HDFS. Unless specified otherwise,
# HDFS file creation will use HDFS default settings with respect to block-size,
# replication factor, etc.
#
# You can also directly specify the paths to hdfs-default.xml and hdfs-site.xml
# via keys 'fs.hdfs.hdfsdefault' and 'fs.hdfs.hdfssite'.
#
# fs.hdfs.hadoopconf: /path/to/hadoop/conf/


#==============================================================================
# High Availability
#==============================================================================

# The list of ZooKeeper quorum peers that coordinate the high-availability
# setup. This must be a list of the form:
#
# "host1:clientPort,host2:clientPort,..." (default clientPort: 2181)
#

# high-availability: zookeeper
# high-availability.zookeeper.quorum: localhost:2181
# high-availability.zookeeper.storageDir: hdfs:///flink/ha/

# ACL options are based on https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_BuiltinACLSchemes
# It can be either "creator" (ZOO_CREATE_ALL_ACL) or "open" (ZOO_OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE)
# The default value is "open" and it can be changed to "creator" if ZK security is enabled
#
# high-availability.zookeeper.client.acl: open

#==============================================================================
# Flink Cluster Security Configuration (optional configuration)
#==============================================================================

# Kerberos security for the connectors can be enabled by providing below configurations
# Security works in two modes - keytab/principal combination or using the Kerberos token cache
# If keytab and principal are not provided, token cache (manual kinit) will be used

#security.keytab: /path/to/kerberos/keytab
#security.principal: flink-user

#==============================================================================
# ZK Security Configuration (optional configuration)
#==============================================================================
# Below configurations are applicable if ZK quorum is configured for Kerberos security

# SASL authentication is disabled by default and can be enabled by changig the value to false
#
# zookeeper.sasl.disable: true

# Override below configuration to provide custom ZK service name if configured
#
# zookeeper.sasl.service-name: zookeeper
