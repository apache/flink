	<!-- dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.enable and
	dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.policy are introduced as part of FLINK-29710
	When the cluster size is extremely small, e.g. 3 nodes or less, cluster
	administrators may want to set the policy to NEVER in the default
	configuration file or disable this feature. Otherwise, users may
	experience an unusually high rate of pipeline failures since it is
	impossible to find new datanodes for replacement.
