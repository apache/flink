 * <p>You can also generate a .jar file that you can submit on your Flink
 * cluster.
 * Just type
 * 		mvn clean package
 * in the projects root directory.
 * You will find the jar in
 * 		target/${artifactId}-${version}.jar
 * From the CLI you can then run
 * 		./bin/flink run -c ${package}.BatchJob target/${artifactId}-${version}.jar
 *
 * <p>For more information on the CLI see:
