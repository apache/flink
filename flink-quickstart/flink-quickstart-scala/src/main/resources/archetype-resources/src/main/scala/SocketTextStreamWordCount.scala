/**
 * This example shows an implementation of WordCount with data from a text socket. 
 * To run the example make sure that the service providing the text data is already up and running.
 *
 * To start an example socket text stream on your local machine run netcat from a command line, 
 * where the parameter specifies the port number:
 *
 * {{{
 *   nc -lk 9999
 * }}}
 *
 * Usage:
 * {{{
 *   SocketTextStreamWordCount <hostname> <port> <output path>
 * }}}
 *
 * This example shows how to:
 *
 *   - use StreamExecutionEnvironment.socketTextStream
 *   - write a simple Flink Streaming program in scala.
 *   - write and use user-defined functions.
