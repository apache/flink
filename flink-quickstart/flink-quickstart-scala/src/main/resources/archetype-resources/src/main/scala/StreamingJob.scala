 * Skeleton for a Flink Streaming Job.
 *
 * For a full example of a Flink Streaming Job, see the SocketTextStreamWordCount.java
 * file in the same package/directory or have a look at the website.
 *
 * You can also generate a .jar file that you can submit on your Flink
 * cluster. Just type
 * {{{
 *   mvn clean package
 * }}}
 * in the projects root directory. You will find the jar in
 * target/flink-quickstart-${version}.jar
 * From the CLI you can then run
 * {{{
 *    ./bin/flink run -c ${package}.StreamingJob target/flink-quickstart-${version}.jar
 * }}}
 *
 * For more information on the CLI see:
 *
 * http://flink.apache.org/docs/latest/apis/cli.html
