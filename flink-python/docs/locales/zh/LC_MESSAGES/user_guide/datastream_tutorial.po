"Apache Flink offers a DataStream API for building robust, stateful "
"streaming applications. It provides fine-grained control over state and "
"time, which allows for the implementation of advanced event-driven "
"systems. In this step-by-step guide, you’ll learn how to build a simple "
"streaming application with PyFlink and the DataStream API."

"DataStream API applications begin by declaring an execution environment "
