"Apache Flink offers a Table API as a unified, relational API for batch "
"and stream processing, i.e., queries are executed with the same semantics"
" on unbounded, real-time streams or bounded, batch data sets and produce "
"the same results. The Table API in Flink is commonly used to ease the "
"definition of data analytics, data pipelining, and ETL applications."
