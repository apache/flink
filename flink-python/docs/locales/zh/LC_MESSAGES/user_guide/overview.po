"PyFlink is a Python API for Apache Flink that allows you to build "
"scalable batch and streaming workloads, such as real-time data processing"
" pipelines, large-scale exploratory data analysis, Machine Learning (ML) "
"pipelines and ETL processes. If you're already familiar with Python and "
"libraries such as Pandas, then PyFlink makes it simpler to leverage the "
"full capabilities of the Flink ecosystem. Depending on the level of "
"abstraction you need, there are two different APIs that can be used in "
"PyFlink:"

"At the same time, the **PyFlink DataStream API** gives you lower-level "
"control over the core building blocks of Flink, `state "

"/stateful-stream-processing/>`_ and `time "
"<https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-"
