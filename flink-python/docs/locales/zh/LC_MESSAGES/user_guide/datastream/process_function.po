"Python user-defined functions are executed in a separate Python process "
"from Flink's operators which run in a JVM, the timer registration "
"requests made in ``ProcessFunction`` will be sent to the Java operator "
"asynchronously. Once received timer registration requests, the Java "
"operator will register it into the underlying timer service."

"If the registered timer has already passed the current time (the current "
"system time for processing time timer, or the current watermark for event"
" time), it will be triggered immediately."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_guide/datastream/process_function.rst:49
msgid ""
"Note that, due to the asynchronous processing characteristics, it may "
"happen that the timer was triggered a little later than the actual time. "
"For example, a registered processing time timer of ``10:00:00`` may be "
"actually processed at ``10:00:05``."
