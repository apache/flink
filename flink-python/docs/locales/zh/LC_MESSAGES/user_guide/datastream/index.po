"DataStream programs in Flink are regular programs that implement "
"transformations on data streams (e.g., filtering, updating state, "
"defining windows, aggregating). The data streams are initially created "
"from various sources (e.g., message queues, socket streams, files). "
"Results are returned via sinks, which may for example write the data to "
"files, or to standard output (for example the command line terminal)."
