# PyFlink Documentation

This directory contains the Sphinx-based Python documentation for Apache Flink (PyDocs). It includes API reference documentation (auto-generated from docstrings) and a user guide with tutorials and guides for PyFlink users.

The built documentation is published at:
- **English:** `https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-{version}/api/python/`
- **Chinese:** `https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-{version}/api/python/zh/`

## Prerequisites

Install the Sphinx dependencies from the project's `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
cd flink-python
pip install -e ".[sphinx]"
```

This installs Sphinx, the pydata theme, sphinx-intl, and other required packages.

## Building the Documentation

All commands should be run from the `flink-python/docs/` directory.

### English only

```bash
make html
```

Output: `_build/html/` — open `_build/html/index.html` in a browser.

### English + Chinese

```bash
make html-zh
```

This builds English into `_build/html/` and Chinese into `_build/html/zh/`. A language toggle in the navbar allows switching between them.

### Chinese only

If the English docs are already built (e.g., in CI where `lint-python.sh` builds them first):

```bash
make zh
```

This runs `gettext` → `sphinx-intl update` → Chinese HTML build into `_build/html/zh/`.

### Serving locally

```bash
make serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/.

## Cross-References to Main Flink Docs

Links to pages in the main Flink documentation (the Hugo site) use the `:flinkdoc:` role, powered by Sphinx's `extlinks` extension:

```rst
See the :flinkdoc:`CLI documentation <docs/deployment/cli/>` for details.
```

This renders as a link to `https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/cli/` by default.

The base URL is controlled by the `FLINK_DOCS_BASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# For a specific release:
export FLINK_DOCS_BASE_URL="https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-2.2"
make html
```

In CI, this is set automatically from the git branch name (see `.github/workflows/docs.sh`). For local builds, it defaults to `flink-docs-master`.

## Translations (Chinese)

Chinese translations use Sphinx's built-in [internationalization](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html) system based on GNU gettext. Here's how it works:

### How it works

1. **`.pot` files** (PO Templates) — Auto-generated from the English `.rst` sources. Each paragraph becomes a translatable string (`msgid`). These are build artifacts in `_build/gettext/` and should never be edited manually.

2. **`.po` files** (Portable Object) — One per `.rst` file per language, stored in `locales/zh/LC_MESSAGES/`. Each file contains `msgid`/`msgstr` pairs where `msgid` is the English source text and `msgstr` is the Chinese translation. **These are the files you edit.**

3. **`.mo` files** (Machine Object) — Compiled binary versions of `.po` files, generated automatically during the build. These are gitignored.

### Updating an existing translation

Edit the relevant `.po` file in `locales/zh/LC_MESSAGES/user_guide/`. For example, to update the Chinese translation of the debugging guide:

```bash
# Edit the .po file
vi locales/zh/LC_MESSAGES/user_guide/debugging.po
```

Each entry looks like:

```po
#: ../../user_guide/debugging.rst:10
msgid "Logging"
msgstr "日志"
```

- `msgid` — The English source text (do not modify)
- `msgstr` — The Chinese translation (this is what you edit)
- Empty `msgstr ""` means untranslated (the English text will be shown)

After editing, rebuild the Chinese docs:

```bash
make zh
```

### Adding translations for a new page

When a new `.rst` page is added to `user_guide/`, the translation workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Regenerate .pot templates from the updated English sources
make gettext

# 2. Create/update .po files for Chinese
sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l zh

# 3. Edit the new .po file in locales/zh/LC_MESSAGES/user_guide/
#    Fill in msgstr values with Chinese translations

# 4. Build to verify
make html-zh
```

### Syncing after English content changes

When the English `.rst` source is updated, the `.po` files need to be synced:

```bash
make gettext
sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l zh
```

This preserves existing translations and marks changed entries as `#, fuzzy`. Fuzzy entries use the old translation as a suggestion but need review. Remove the `#, fuzzy` marker after verifying the translation is still correct.

### RST markup in translations

Translations must preserve RST inline markup exactly. Common patterns:

```po
# Inline code
msgid "Use ``TableEnvironment`` to create tables."
msgstr "使用 ``TableEnvironment`` 创建表。"

# Bold
msgid "This is **important**."
msgstr "这是 **重要的**。"

# Links
msgid "See `Apache Flink <https://flink.apache.org>`_ for details."
msgstr "详情请参阅 `Apache Flink <https://flink.apache.org>`_ 。"
```

Note: RST requires a space before and after inline markup (`` `` ``, `**`, etc.). This includes before Chinese punctuation — `` ``code`` 。`` not `` ``code``。``.

## Adding a New User Guide Page

1. Create the `.rst` file in the appropriate subdirectory:

   ```bash
   vi user_guide/my_new_page.rst
   ```

   Use an existing page as a template for the license header and heading style.

2. Add the page to the parent `index.rst` toctree:

   ```rst
   .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 2

       existing_page
       my_new_page        <-- add here
   ```

3. Generate the translation stub:

   ```bash
   make gettext
   sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l zh
   ```

4. Optionally populate `locales/zh/LC_MESSAGES/user_guide/my_new_page.po` with Chinese translations.

5. Build and verify:

   ```bash
   make html-zh
   ```
