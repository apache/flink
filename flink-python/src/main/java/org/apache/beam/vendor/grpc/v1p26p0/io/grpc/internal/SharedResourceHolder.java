/**
 * A holder for shared resource singletons.
 *
 * <p>Components like client channels and servers need certain resources, e.g. a thread pool, to
 * run. If the user has not provided such resources, these components will use a default one, which
 * is shared as a static resource. This class holds these default resources and manages their
 * life-cycles.
 *
 * <p>A resource is identified by the reference of a {@link Resource} object, which is typically a
 * singleton, provided to the get() and release() methods. Each Resource object (not its class) maps
 * to an object cached in the holder.
 *
 * <p>Resources are ref-counted and shut down after a delay when the ref-count reaches zero.
