class CompiledPlan(object):
    """
    Represents an immutable, fully optimized, and executable entity that has been compiled from a
    Table & SQL API pipeline definition. It encodes operators, expressions, functions, data types,
    and table connectors.

    Every new Flink version might introduce improved optimizer rules, more efficient operators,
    and other changes that impact the behavior of previously defined pipelines. In order to ensure
    backwards compatibility and enable stateful streaming job upgrades, compiled plans can be
    persisted and reloaded across Flink versions. See the website documentation for more
    information about provided guarantees during stateful pipeline upgrades.

    A plan can be compiled from a SQL query using
    :func:`~pyflink.table.TableEnvironment.compile_plan_sql`.
    It can be persisted using :func:`~pyflink.table.CompiledPlan.write_to_file` or by manually
    extracting the JSON representation with func:`~pyflink.table.CompiledPlan.as_json_string`.
    A plan can be loaded back from a file or a string using
    :func:`~pyflink.table.TableEnvironment.load_plan` with a :class:`~pyflink.table.PlanReference`.
    Instances can be executed using :func:`~pyflink.table.CompiledPlan.execute`.

    Depending on the configuration, permanent catalog metadata (such as information about tables
    and functions) will be persisted in the plan as well. Anonymous/inline objects will be
    persisted (including schema and options) if possible or fail the compilation otherwise.
    For temporary objects, only the identifier is part of the plan and the object needs to be
    present in the session context during a restore.

    JSON encoding is assumed to be the default representation of a compiled plan in all API
    endpoints, and is the format used to persist the plan to files by default.
    For advanced use cases, :func:`~pyflink.table.CompiledPlan.as_smile_bytes` provides a binary
    format representation of the compiled plan.

    .. note::
        Plan restores assume a stable session context. Configuration, loaded modules and
        catalogs, and temporary objects must not change. Schema evolution and changes of function
        signatures are not supported.
