    Schema of a table or view.

    A schema represents the schema part of a {@code CREATE TABLE (schema) WITH (options)} DDL
    statement in SQL. It defines columns of different kind, constraints, time attributes, and
    watermark strategies. It is possible to reference objects (such as functions or types) across
    different catalogs.

    This class is used in the API and catalogs to define an unresolved schema that will be
    translated to ResolvedSchema. Some methods of this class perform basic validation, however, the
    main validation happens during the resolution. Thus, an unresolved schema can be incomplete and
    might be enriched or merged with a different schema at a later stage.

    Since an instance of this class is unresolved, it should not be directly persisted. The str()
    shows only a summary of the contained objects.

            Computed columns are virtual columns that are generated by evaluating an expression
            that can reference other columns declared in the same table. Both physical columns and
            metadata columns can be accessed. The column itself is not physically stored within the
            table. The columnâ€™s data type is derived automatically from the given expression and

            Computed columns are commonly used for defining time attributes. For example, the
            computed column can be used if the original field is not TIMESTAMP(3) type or is nested
            in a JSON string.

            Declares a metadata column that is appended to this schema.

            Metadata columns allow to access connector and/or format specific fields for every row
            of a table. For example, a metadata column can be used to read and write the timestamp
            from and to Kafka records for time-based operations. The connector and format
            documentation lists the available metadata fields for every component.

            Every metadata field is identified by a string-based key and has a documented data
            type. The metadata key can be omitted if the column name should be used as the
            identifying metadata key. For convenience, the runtime will perform an explicit cast if
            the data type of the column differs from the data type of the metadata field. Of course,
            this requires that the two data types are compatible.

            By default, a metadata column can be used for both reading and writing. However, in
            many cases an external system provides more read-only metadata fields than writable
            fields. Therefore, it is possible to exclude metadata columns from persisting by setting

            top-level column in the schema. It may be a computed column.

            The watermark generation expression is evaluated by the framework for every record
            during runtime. The framework will periodically emit the largest generated watermark. If
            the current watermark is still identical to the previous one, or is null, or the value
            of the returned watermark is smaller than that of the last emitted one, then no new
            watermark will be emitted. A watermark is emitted in an interval defined by the
            configuration.

            Any scalar expression can be used for declaring a watermark strategy for
            in-memory/temporary tables. However, currently, only SQL expressions can be persisted in
            a catalog. The expression's return data type must be {@code TIMESTAMP(3)}. User-defined
