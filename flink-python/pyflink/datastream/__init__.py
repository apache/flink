Entry point classes of Flink DataStream API:

    - :class:`StreamExecutionEnvironment`:
      The context in which a streaming program is executed.
    - :class:`DataStream`:
      Represents a stream of elements of the same type. A DataStream can be transformed
      into another DataStream by applying a transformation.
    - :class:`KeyedStream`:
      Represents a :class:`DataStream` where elements are partitioned by key using a
      provided KeySelector.
    - :class:`WindowedStream`:
      Represents a data stream where elements are grouped by key, and for each
      key, the stream of elements is split into windows based on a WindowAssigner. Window emission
      is triggered based on a Trigger.
    - :class:`ConnectedStreams`:
      Represent two connected streams of (possibly) different data types. Connected
      streams are useful for cases where operations on one stream directly affect the operations on
      the other stream, usually via shared state between the streams.
    - :class:`BroadcastStream`:
      Represent a stream with :class:`state.BroadcastState` (s).
    - :class:`BroadcastConnectedStream`:
      Represents the result of connecting a keyed or non-keyed stream, with a
      :class:`BroadcastStream` with :class:`state.BroadcastState` (s)

Functions used to transform a :class:`DataStream` into another :class:`DataStream`:

    - :class:`MapFunction`:
      Performs a map transformation of a :class:`DataStream` at element wise.
    - :class:`CoMapFunction`:

      Performs a flatmap transformation of a :class:`DataStream` which produces zero, one, or more
      elements for each input element.
    - :class:`CoFlatMapFunction`:
      Performs a flatmap transformation over two connected streams.
    - :class:`FilterFunction`:

      watermark in :class:`CoProcessFunction`.
    - :class:`KeyedCoProcessFunction`:
      Similar to :class:`CoProcessFunction`, except that it was applied to a keyed

      contextual information (such as the current parallelism), etc.

      checkpoints based on the configured :class:`CheckpointStorage`.

      state that exceeds memory and spills to local disk.
    - :class:`CustomStateBackend`:
      A wrapper of customized java state backend.
    - :class:`JobManagerCheckpointStorage`:
      Checkpoints state directly to the JobManager's memory (hence the name), but savepoints will

      Checkpoints state as files to a file system. Each checkpoint individually will store all its
      files in a subdirectory that includes the checkpoint number, such as

    - :class:`CustomCheckpointStorage`:
      A wrapper of customized java checkpoint storage.

Classes for state operations:

    - :class:`state.ValueState`:
      Interface for partitioned single-value state. The value can be retrieved or updated.
    - :class:`state.ListState`:
      Interface for partitioned list state in Operations. The state is accessed and modified by
      user functions, and checkpointed consistently by the system as part of the distributed
      snapshots.

      Interface for partitioned key-value state. The key-value pair can be added, updated and
      retrieved.
    - :class:`state.ReducingState`:
      Interface for reducing state. Elements can be added to the state, they will be combined using
      a :class:`ReduceFunction`. The current state can be inspected.
    - :class:`state.AggregatingState`:
      Interface for aggregating state, based on an :class:`AggregateFunction`. Elements that are
      added to this type of state will be eagerly pre-aggregated using a given AggregateFunction.
    - :class:`state.BroadcastState`:
      A type of state that can be created to store the state of a :class:`BroadcastStream`. This
      state assumes that the same elements are sent to all instances of an operator.

      A read-only view of the :class:`state.BroadcastState`.
    - :class:`state.StateTtlConfig`:
