    the source into continuous streaming mode.

    <h2>Format Types</h2>

    The reading of each file happens through file readers defined by <i>file formats</i>. These

    assigned to each subtask of the sink and a rolling counter to determine the file names. For
    example with a prefix "prefix" and a suffix ".ext", a file named {@code
    "prefix-81fc4980-a6af-41c8-9937-9939408a734b-17.ext"} contains the data from subtask with uid
    {@code 81fc4980-a6af-41c8-9937-9939408a734b} of the sink and is the {@code 17th} part-file
    created by that subtask.

    Part files roll based on the user-specified RollingPolicy. By default, a DefaultRollingPolicy
    is used for row-encoded sink output; a OnCheckpointRollingPolicy is
    used for bulk-encoded sink output.

    In some scenarios, the open buckets are required to change based on time. In these cases, the
    user can specify a bucket_check_interval (by default 1m) and the sink will check
    periodically and roll the part file if the specified rolling policy says so.

    Part files can be in one of three states: in-progress, pending or finished. The reason for this
    is how the sink works to provide exactly-once semantics and fault-tolerance. The part file that
    is currently being written to is in-progress. Once a part file is closed for writing it becomes
    pending. When a checkpoint is successful (for STREAMING) or at the end of the job (for BATCH)
    the currently pending files will be moved to finished.

    For STREAMING in order to guarantee exactly-once semantics in case of a failure, the
    sink should roll back to the state it had when that last successful checkpoint occurred. To this
    end, when restoring, the restored files in pending state are transferred into the finished state
    while any in-progress files are rolled back, so that they do not contain data that arrived after
    the checkpoint from which we restore.
