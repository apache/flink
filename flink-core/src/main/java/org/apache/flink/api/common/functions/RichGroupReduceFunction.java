/**
 * Rich variant of the {@link GroupReduceFunction}. As a {@link RichFunction}, it gives access to the
 * {@link org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RuntimeContext} and provides setup and teardown methods:
 * {@link RichFunction#open(org.apache.flink.configuration.Configuration)} and
 * {@link RichFunction#close()}.
 *
 * Partial computation can significantly improve the performance of a {@link RichGroupReduceFunction}.
 * This technique is also known as applying a Combiner.
 * Implement the {@link GroupCombineFunction<IN, IN>} interface to enable partial computation, i.e.,
 * a combiner for this {@link RichGroupReduceFunction}.
 * 
 * @param <IN> Type of the elements that this function processes.
 * @param <OUT> The type of the elements returned by the user-defined function.
