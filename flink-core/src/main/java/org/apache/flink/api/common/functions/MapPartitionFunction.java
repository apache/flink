 * Interface for "mapPartition" functions. A "mapPartition" function is called a single time per

 * This function is intended to provide enhanced flexibility in the processing of elements in a partition.
 * For most of the simple use cases, consider using the {@link MapFunction} or {@link FlatMapFunction}.

 * <pre><blockquote>
 * DataSet<X> input = ...;
 * 
 * DataSet<Y> result = input.mapPartition(new MyMapPartitionFunction());
 * </blockquote></pre>
 * 
 * @param <T> Type of the input elements.
 * @param <O> Type of the returned elements.
