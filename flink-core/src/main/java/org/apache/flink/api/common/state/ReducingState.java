/**
 * {@link State} interface for reducing state. Elements can be added to the state, they will be
 * combined using a reduce function. The current state can be inspected.
 *
 * <p>The state is accessed and modified by user functions, and checkpointed consistently by the
 * system as part of the distributed snapshots.
 *
 * <p>The state is only accessible by functions applied on a {@code KeyedStream}. The key is
 * automatically supplied by the system, so the function always sees the value mapped to the key of
 * the current element. That way, the system can handle stream and state partitioning consistently
 * together.
