	 * <p>Each operator instance individually maintains and stores elements in the broadcast state. The fact that the
	 * incoming stream is a broadcast one guarantees that all instances see all the elements. Upon recovery
	 * or re-scaling, the same state is given to each of the instances. To avoid hotspots, each task reads its previous
	 * partition, and if there are more tasks (scale up), then the new instances read from the old instances in a round
	 * robin fashion. This is why each instance has to guarantee that it stores the same elements as the rest. If not,
	 * upon recovery or rescaling you may have unpredictable redistribution of the partitions, thus unpredictable results.
