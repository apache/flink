/**
 * The interface for CoGroup functions. CoGroup functions combine two data sets by first grouping each data set
 * after a key and then "joining" the groups by calling this function with the two sets for each key. 
 * If a key is present in only one of the two inputs, it may be that one of the groups is empty.
 * <p>
 * The basic syntax for using CoGoup on two data sets is as follows:
 * <pre><blockquote>
 * DataSet<X> set1 = ...;
 * DataSet<Y> set2 = ...;
 * 
 * set1.coGroup(set2).where(<key-definition>).equalTo(<key-definition>).with(new MyCoGroupFunction());
 * </blockquote></pre>
 * <p>
 * {@code set1} is here considered the first input, {@code set2} the second input.
 * <p>
 * Some keys may only be contained in one of the two original data sets. In that case, the CoGroup function is invoked
 * with in empty input for the side of the data set that did not contain elements with that specific key.
 * 
 * @param <IN1> The data type of the first input data set.
 * @param <IN2> The data type of the second input data set.
 * @param <O> The data type of the returned elements.
