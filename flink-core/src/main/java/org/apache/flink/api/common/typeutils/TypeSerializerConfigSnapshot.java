/**
 * A {@code TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot} is a point-in-time view of a {@link TypeSerializer's} configuration.
 * The configuration snapshot of a serializer is persisted within checkpoints
 * as a single source of meta information about the schema of serialized data in the checkpoint.
 * This serves three purposes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Capturing serializer parameters and schema:</strong> a serializer's configuration snapshot
 *   represents information about the parameters, state, and schema of a serializer.
 *   This is explained in more detail below.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>Compatibility checks for new serializers:</strong> when new serializers are available,
 *   they need to be checked whether or not they are compatible to read the data written by the previous serializer.
 *   This is performed by providing the new serializer to the corresponding serializer configuration
 *   snapshots in checkpoints.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>Factory for a read serializer when schema conversion is required:<strong> in the case that new
 *   serializers are not compatible to read previous data, a schema conversion process executed across all data
 *   is required before the new serializer can be continued to be used. This conversion process requires a compatible
 *   read serializer to restore serialized bytes as objects, and then written back again using the new serializer.
 *   In this scenario, the serializer configuration snapshots in checkpoints doubles as a factory for the read
 *   serializer of the conversion process.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Serializer Configuration and Schema</h2>
 *
 * <p>Since serializer configuration snapshots needs to be used to ensure serialization compatibility
 * for the same managed state as well as serving as a factory for compatible read serializers, the configuration
 * snapshot should encode sufficient information about:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Parameter settings of the serializer:</strong> parameters of the serializer include settings
 *   required to setup the serializer, or the state of the serializer if it is stateful. If the serializer
 *   has nested serializers, then the configuration snapshot should also contain the parameters of the nested
 *   serializers.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>Serialization schema of the serializer:</strong> the binary format used by the serializer, or
 *   in other words, the schema of data written by the serializer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Implementations must contain the default empty nullary constructor. This is required to be able to
 * deserialize the configuration snapshot from its binary form.
 *
 * @param <T> The data type that the originating serializer of this configuration serializes.
 *
 * @deprecated This class has been deprecated since Flink 1.7, and will eventually be removed.
 *             Please refer to, and directly implement a {@link TypeSerializerSnapshot} instead.
 *             Class-level Javadocs of {@link TypeSerializerSnapshot} provides more details
 *             on migrating to the new interface.
