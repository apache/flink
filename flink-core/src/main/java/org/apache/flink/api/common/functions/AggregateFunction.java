/**
 * The {@code AggregateFunction} is a flexible aggregation function, characterized by the
 * following features:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The aggregates may use different types for input values, intermediate aggregates,
 *         and result type, to support a wide range of aggregation types.</li>
 * 
 *     <li>Support for distributive aggregations: Different intermediate aggregates can be
 *         merged together, to allow for pre-aggregation/final-aggregation optimizations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@code AggregateFunction}'s intermediate aggregate (in-progress aggregation state)
 * is called the <i>accumulator</i>. Values are added to the accumulator, and final aggregates are
 * obtained by finalizing the accumulator state. This supports aggregation functions where the
 * intermediate state needs to be different than the aggregated values and the final result type,
 * such as for example <i>average</i> (which typically keeps a count and sum).
 * Merging intermediate aggregates (partial aggregates) means merging the accumulators.  
 * 
 * <p>The AggregationFunction itself is stateless. To allow a single AggregationFunction
 * instance to maintain multiple aggregates (such as one aggregate per key), the
 * AggregationFunction creates a new accumulator whenever a new aggregation is started.
 * 
 * <p>Aggregation functions must be {@link Serializable} because they are sent around
 * between distributed processes during distributed execution.
 *

 *         return acc.sum / (double) acc.count;
