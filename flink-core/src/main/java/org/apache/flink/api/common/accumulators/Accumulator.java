/**
 * Accumulators collect distributed statistics or aggregates in a from user functions
 * and operators. Each parallel instance creates and updates its own accumulator object,
 * and the different parallel instances of the accumulator are later merged.
 * merged by the system at the end of the job. The result can be obtained from the
 * result of a job execution, or from teh web runtime monitor.
 *
 * The accumulators are inspired by the Hadoop/MapReduce counters.
 * 
 * The type added to the accumulator might differ from the type returned. This
 * is the case e.g. for a set-accumulator: We add single objects, but the result
 * is a set of objects.

 *            Type of values that are added to the accumulator
 * @param <R>
