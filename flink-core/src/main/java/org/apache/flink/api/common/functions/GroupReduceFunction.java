 * The interface for group reduce functions. GroupReduceFunctions process groups of elements.

 * <p>
 * For a reduce functions that works incrementally by combining always two elements, see 
 * {@link ReduceFunction}.

 * DataSet<X> input = ...;

 * DataSet<X> result = input.groupBy(<key-definition>).reduceGroup(new MyGroupReduceFunction());
