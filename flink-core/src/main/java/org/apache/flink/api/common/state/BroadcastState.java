/**
 * A type of state that can be created to store the state of a {@code BroadcastStream}. This state assumes that
 * <b>the same elements are sent to all instances of an operator.</b>
 *
 * <p><b>CAUTION:</b> the user has to guarantee that all task instances store the same elements in this type of state.
 *
 * <p> Each operator instance individually maintains and stores elements in the broadcast state. The fact that the
 * incoming stream is a broadcast one guarantees that all instances see all the elements. Upon recovery
 * or re-scaling, the same state is given to each of the instances. To avoid hotspots, each task reads its previous
 * partition, and if there are more tasks (scale up), then the new instances read from the old instances in a round
 * robin fashion. This is why each instance has to guarantee that it stores the same elements as the rest. If not,
 * upon recovery or rescaling you may have unpredictable redistribution of the partitions, thus unpredictable results.
 *
 * @param <K> The key type of the elements in the {@link BroadcastState}.
 * @param <V> The value type of the elements in the {@link BroadcastState}.
