/**
 * Base interface for partitioned state that supports adding elements and inspecting the current
 * state. Elements can either be kept in a buffer (list-like) or aggregated into one value.
 *
 * <p>The state is accessed and modified by user functions, and checkpointed consistently
 * by the system as part of the distributed snapshots.
 * 
 * <p>The state is only accessible by functions applied on a {@code KeyedStream}. The key is
 * automatically supplied by the system, so the function always sees the value mapped to the
 * key of the current element. That way, the system can handle stream and state partitioning
 * consistently together.
 * 
 * @param <IN> Type of the value that can be added to the state.
 * @param <OUT> Type of the value that can be retrieved from the state.
