/**
 * A broadcast variable initializer can be used to transform a broadcast variable
 * into another format during initialization. The transformed variable is shared
 * among the parallel instances of a function inside one TaskManager, the
 * same way as the plain broadcast variables (lists) are shared.
 * 
 * <p>The broadcast variable initializer will in many cases only be executed by one
 * parallel function instance per TaskManager, when acquiring the broadcast variable
 * for the first time inside that particular TaskManager. It is possible that a
 * broadcast variable is read and initialized multiple times, if the tasks that use
 * the variables are not overlapping in their execution time; in such cases, it can
 * happen that one function instance released the broadcast variable, and another
 * function instance materializes it again.
 * 
 * <p>This is an example of how to use a broadcast variable initializer, transforming
 * the shared list of values into a shared map.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyFunction extends RichMapFunction<Long, String> {
 *
 *     private Map<Long, String> map;
 *
 *     public void open(Configuration cfg) throws Exception {
 *         getRuntimeContext().getBroadcastVariableWithInitializer("mapvar",
 *             new BroadcastVariableInitializer<Tuple2<Long, String>, Map<Long, String>>() {
 *             
 *                 public Map<Long, String> initializeBroadcastVariable(Iterable<Tuple2<Long, String>> data) {
 *                     Map<Long, String> map = new HashMap<>();
 *                     
 *                     for (Tuple2<Long, String> t : data) {
 *                         map.put(t.f0, t.f1);
 *                     }
 *                     
 *                     return map;
 *                 }
 *             });
 *     }
 *     
 *     public String map(Long value) {
 *         // replace the long by the String, based on the map
 *         return map.get(value);
 *     }
