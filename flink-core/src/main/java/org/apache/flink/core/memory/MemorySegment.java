/**
 * This class represents a piece of memory managed by Flink.
 * The segment may be backed by heap memory (byte array) or by off-heap memory.
 *
 * <p>The methods for individual memory access are specialized in the classes
 * {@link org.apache.flink.core.memory.HeapMemorySegment} and
 * {@link org.apache.flink.core.memory.HybridMemorySegment}.
 * All methods that operate across two memory segments are implemented in this class,
 * to transparently handle the mixing of memory segment types.
 *
 * <p>This class fulfills conceptually a similar purpose as Java's {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}.
 * We add this specialized class for various reasons:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>It offers additional binary compare, swap, and copy methods.</li>
 *     <li>It uses collapsed checks for range check and memory segment disposal.</li>
 *     <li>It offers absolute positioning methods for bulk put/get methods, to guarantee
 *         thread safe use.</li>
 *     <li>It offers explicit big-endian / little-endian access methods, rather than tracking internally
 *         a byte order.</li>
 *     <li>It transparently and efficiently moves data between on-heap and off-heap variants.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><i>Comments on the implementation</i>:
 * We make heavy use of operations that are supported by native
 * instructions, to achieve a high efficiency. Multi byte types (int, long, float, double, ...)
 * are read and written with "unsafe" native commands.
 *
 * <p>Below is an example of the code generated for the {@link HeapMemorySegment#putLongBigEndian(int, long)}
 * function by the just-in-time compiler. The code is grabbed from an Oracle JVM 7 using the
 * hotspot disassembler library (hsdis32.dll) and the jvm command
 * <i>-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:CompileCommand=print,*MemorySegment.putLongBigEndian</i>.
 * Note that this code realizes both the byte order swapping and the reinterpret cast access to
 * get a long from the byte array.

 *
 * <p><i>Note on efficiency</i>:
 * For best efficiency, the code that uses this class should make sure that only one
 * subclass is loaded, or that the methods that are abstract in this class are used only from one of the
 * subclasses (either the {@link org.apache.flink.core.memory.HeapMemorySegment}, or the
 * {@link org.apache.flink.core.memory.HybridMemorySegment}).
 *
 * <p>That way, all the abstract methods in the MemorySegment base class have only one loaded
 * actual implementation. This is easy for the JIT to recognize through class hierarchy analysis,
 * or by identifying that the invocations are monomorphic (all go to the same concrete
 * method implementation). Under these conditions, the JIT can perfectly inline methods.
