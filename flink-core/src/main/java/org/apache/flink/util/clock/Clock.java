/**
 * A clock that gives access to time. This clock returns two flavors of time:
 *
 * <h3>Absolute Time</h3>
 *
 * <p>This refers to real world wall clock time, and it is typically
 * derived from a system clock. It is subject to clock drift and inaccuracy, and can jump if the
 * system clock is adjusted. Absolute time behaves similar to {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}.
 *
 * <h3>Relative Time</h3>
 *
 * <p>This time advances at the same speed as the <i>absolute time</i>,
 * but the timestamps can only be referred to relative to each other. The timestamps have no
 * absolute meaning and cannot be compared across JVM processes. The source for the timestamps is
 * not affected by adjustments to the system clock, so it never jumps. Relative time behaves similar
 * to {@link System#nanoTime()}.
