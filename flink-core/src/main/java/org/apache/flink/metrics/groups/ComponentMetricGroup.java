/**
 * Abstract {@link org.apache.flink.metrics.MetricGroup} for system components (e.g., 
 * TaskManager, Job, Task, Operator).
 * 
 * <p>Usually, the scope of metrics is simply the hierarchy of the containing groups. For example
 * the Metric {@code "MyMetric"} in group {@code "B"} nested in group {@code "A"} would have a
 * fully scoped name of {@code "A.B.MyMetric"}, with {@code "A.B"} being the Metric's scope.
 *
 * <p>Component groups, however, have configurable scopes. This allow users to include or exclude
 * certain identifiers from the scope. The scope for metrics belonging to the "Task"
 * group could for example include the task attempt number (more fine grained identification), or
 * exclude it (for continuity of the namespace across failure and recovery).
