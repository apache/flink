/**
 * Annotation used on classes containing {@link ConfigOption}s that enables the separation of options into different
 * tables based on key prefixes. A {@link ConfigOption} is assigned to a {@link ConfigGroup} if the option key matches
 * the group prefix. If a key matches multiple prefixes the longest matching prefix takes priority. An option is never
 * assigned to multiple groups. Options that don't match any group are implicitly added to a default group.
