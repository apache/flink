/**
 * Base interface for all stream data sources in Flink. The contract of a stream source
 * is similar to an iterator - it is consumed as in the following pseudo code:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * StreamSource<T> source = ...;
 * Collector<T> out = ...;
 * while (!source.reachedEnd()) {
 *   out.collect(source.next());
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <b>Note about blocking behavior</b>
 * <p>This implementations of the methods in the stream sources must have certain guarantees about
 * blocking behavior. One of the two characteristics must be fulfilled.</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The methods must react to thread interrupt calls and break out of blocking calls with
 *         an {@link InterruptedException}.</li>
 *     <li>The method may ignore interrupt calls and/or swallow InterruptedExceptions, if it is guaranteed
 *         that the method returns quasi immediately irrespectively of the input. This is true for example
 *         for file streams, where the call is guaranteed to return after a very short I/O delay in
 *         the order of milliseconds.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @param <T> The type of the records produced by this source.
