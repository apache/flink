 * instances of the source, and which parallel instance the current instance is)
 * via {@link #getRuntimeContext()}. It also provides additional life-cycle methods
 * ({@link #open(org.apache.flink.configuration.Configuration)} and {@link #close()}.</p>
 *
 * @param <OUT> The type of the records produced by this source.
