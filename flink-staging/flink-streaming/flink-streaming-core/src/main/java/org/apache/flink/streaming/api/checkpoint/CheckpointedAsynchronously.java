/**
 * This interface marks a function/operator as <i>asynchronously checkpointed</i>.
 * Similar to the {@link Checkpointed} interface, the function must produce a
 * snapshot of its state. However, the function must be able to continue working
 * and mutating its state without mutating the returned state snapshot.
 * 
 * <p>Asynchronous checkpoints are desirable, because they allow the data streams at the
 * point of the checkpointed function/operator to continue running while the checkpoint
 * is in progress.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To be able to support asynchronous snapshots, the state returned by the
 * {@link #snapshotState(long, long)} method is typically a copy or shadow copy
 * of the actual state.</p>
