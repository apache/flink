 * occur at the same time. The execution must be serial. This is achieved by having the contract
 * with the StreamFunction that it must only modify its state or emit elements in
 * a synchronized block that locks on the lock Object. Also, the modification of the state
 * and the emission of elements must happen in the same block of code that is protected by the
 * synchronized block.

 * @param <OUT> Type of the output elements of this source.
