/**
 * A KeyedWindowDataStream represents a data stream where elements are grouped by key, and 
 * for each key, the stream of elements is split into windows. The windows are conceptually
 * evaluated for each key individually, meaning windows and trigger at different points
 * for each key.
 * <p>
 * In many cases, however, the windows are "aligned", meaning they trigger at the
 * same time for all keys. The most common example for that are the regular time windows.
 * <p>
 * Note that the KeyedWindowDataStream is purely and API construct, during runtime the
 * KeyedWindowDataStream will be collapsed together with the KeyedDataStream and the operation
 * over the window into one single operation.
 * 
 * @param <Type> The type of elements in the stream.
 * @param <Key> The type of the key by which elements are grouped.
