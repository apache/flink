/**
 * Hacky wrapper to send an object instance through a Properties - map.
 *
 * This works as follows:
 * The recommended way of creating a KafkaSink is specifying a classname for the partitioner.
 *
 * Otherwise (if the user gave a (serializable) class instance), we give Kafka the PartitionerWrapper class of Flink.
 * This is set in the key-value (java.util.Properties) map.
 * In addition to that, we use the Properties.put(Object, Object) to store the instance of the (serializable).
 * This is a hack because the put() method is called on the underlying Hashmap.
 *
 * This PartitionerWrapper is called with the Properties. From there, we extract the wrapped Partitioner instance.
 *
 * The serialziable PartitionerWrapper is serialized into the Properties Hashmap and also deserialized from there.
