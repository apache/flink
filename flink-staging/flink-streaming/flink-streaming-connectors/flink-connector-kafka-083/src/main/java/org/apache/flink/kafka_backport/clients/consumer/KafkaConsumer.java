/**
 * A Kafka client that consumes records from a Kafka cluster.
 * <p>
 * It will transparently handle the failure of servers in the Kafka cluster, and transparently adapt as partitions of
 * data it subscribes to migrate within the cluster. This client also interacts with the server to allow groups of
 * consumers to load balance consumption using consumer groups (as described below).
 * <p>
 * The consumer maintains TCP connections to the necessary brokers to fetch data for the topics it subscribes to.
 * Failure to close the consumer after use will leak these connections.
 * <p>
 * The consumer is not thread-safe. See <a href="#multithreaded">Multi-threaded Processing</a> for more details.
 *
 * <h3>Offsets and Consumer Position</h3>
 * Kafka maintains a numerical offset for each record in a partition. This offset acts as a kind of unique identifier of
 * a record within that partition, and also denotes the position of the consumer in the partition. That is, a consumer
 * which has position 5 has consumed records with offsets 0 through 4 and will next receive record with offset 5. There
 * are actually two notions of position relevant to the user of the consumer.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #position(TopicPartition) position} of the consumer gives the offset of the next record that will be given
 * out. It will be one larger than the highest offset the consumer has seen in that partition. It automatically advances
 * every time the consumer receives data calls {@link #poll(long)} and receives messages.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #commit(CommitType) committed position} is the last offset that has been saved securely. Should the
 * process fail and restart, this is the offset that it will recover to. The consumer can either automatically commit
 * offsets periodically, or it can choose to control this committed position manually by calling
 * {@link #commit(CommitType) commit}.
 * <p>
 * This distinction gives the consumer control over when a record is considered consumed. It is discussed in further
 * detail below.
 * 
 * <h3>Consumer Groups</h3>
 * 
 * Kafka uses the concept of <i>consumer groups</i> to allow a pool of processes to divide up the work of consuming and
 * processing records. These processes can either be running on the same machine or, as is more likely, they can be
 * distributed over many machines to provide additional scalability and fault tolerance for processing.
 * <p>
 * Each Kafka consumer must specify a consumer group that it belongs to. Kafka will deliver each message in the
 * subscribed topics to one process in each consumer group. This is achieved by balancing the partitions in the topic
 * over the consumer processes in each group. So if there is a topic with four partitions, and a consumer group with two
 * processes, each process would consume from two partitions. This group membership is maintained dynamically: if a
 * process fails the partitions assigned to it will be reassigned to other processes in the same group, and if a new
 * process joins the group, partitions will be moved from existing consumers to this new process.
 * <p>
 * So if two processes subscribe to a topic both specifying different groups they will each get all the records in that
 * topic; if they both specify the same group they will each get about half the records.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually you can think of a consumer group as being a single logical subscriber that happens to be made up of
 * multiple processes. As a multi-subscriber system, Kafka naturally supports having any number of consumer groups for a
 * given topic without duplicating data (additional consumers are actually quite cheap).
 * <p>
 * This is a slight generalization of the functionality that is common in messaging systems. To get semantics similar to
 * a queue in a traditional messaging system all processes would be part of a single consumer group and hence record
 * delivery would be balanced over the group like with a queue. Unlike a traditional messaging system, though, you can
 * have multiple such groups. To get semantics similar to pub-sub in a traditional messaging system each process would
 * have it's own consumer group, so each process would subscribe to all the records published to the topic.
 * <p>
 * In addition, when offsets are committed they are always committed for a given consumer group.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible for the consumer to manually specify the partitions it subscribes to, which disables this dynamic
 * partition balancing.
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * The consumer APIs offer flexibility to cover a variety of consumption use cases. Here are some examples to
 * demonstrate how to use them.
 * 
 * <h4>Simple Processing</h4>
 * This example demonstrates the simplest usage of Kafka's consumer api.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Properties props = new Properties();
 *     props.put(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;enable.auto.commit&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;auto.commit.interval.ms&quot;, &quot;1000&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;session.timeout.ms&quot;, &quot;30000&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt;(props);
 *     consumer.subscribe(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);
 *     while (true) {
 *         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(100);
 *         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records)
 *             System.out.printf(&quot;offset = %d, key = %s, value = %s&quot;, record.offset(), record.key(), record.value());
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Setting <code>enable.auto.commit</code> means that offsets are committed automatically with a frequency controlled by
 * the config <code>auto.commit.interval.ms</code>.
 * <p>
 * The connection to the cluster is bootstrapped by specifying a list of one or more brokers to contact using the
 * configuration <code>bootstrap.servers</code>. This list is just used to discover the rest of the brokers in the
 * cluster and need not be an exhaustive list of servers in the cluster (though you may want to specify more than one in
 * case there are servers down when the client is connecting).
 * <p>
 * In this example the client is subscribing to the topics <i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i> as part of a group of consumers
 * called <i>test</i> as described above.
 * <p>
 * The broker will automatically detect failed processes in the <i>test</i> group by using a heartbeat mechanism. The
 * consumer will automatically ping the cluster periodically, which let's the cluster know that it is alive. As long as
 * the consumer is able to do this it is considered alive and retains the right to consume from the partitions assigned
 * to it. If it stops heartbeating for a period of time longer than <code>session.timeout.ms</code> then it will be
 * considered dead and it's partitions will be assigned to another process.
 * <p>
 * The deserializer settings specify how to turn bytes into objects. For example, by specifying string deserializers, we
 * are saying that our record's key and value will just be simple strings.
 * 
 * <h4>Controlling When Messages Are Considered Consumed</h4>
 * 
 * In this example we will consume a batch of records and batch them up in memory, when we have sufficient records
 * batched we will insert them into a database. If we allowed offsets to auto commit as in the previous example messages
 * would be considered consumed after they were given out by the consumer, and it would be possible that our process
 * could fail after we have read messages into our in-memory buffer but before they had been inserted into the database.
 * To avoid this we will manually commit the offsets only once the corresponding messages have been inserted into the
 * database. This gives us exact control of when a message is considered consumed. This raises the opposite possibility:
 * the process could fail in the interval after the insert into the database but before the commit (even though this
 * would likely just be a few milliseconds, it is a possibility). In this case the process that took over consumption
 * would consume from last committed offset and would repeat the insert of the last batch of data. Used in this way
 * Kafka provides what is often called "at-least once delivery" guarantees, as each message will likely be delivered one
 * time but in failure cases could be duplicated.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Properties props = new Properties();
 *     props.put(&quot;bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;localhost:9092&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;group.id&quot;, &quot;test&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;enable.auto.commit&quot;, &quot;false&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;auto.commit.interval.ms&quot;, &quot;1000&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;session.timeout.ms&quot;, &quot;30000&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;key.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     props.put(&quot;value.deserializer&quot;, &quot;org.apache.StringDeserializer&quot;);
 *     KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt;(props);
 *     consumer.subscribe(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);
 *     int commitInterval = 200;
 *     List&lt;ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; buffer = new ArrayList&lt;ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;();
 *     while (true) {
 *         ConsumerRecords&lt;String, String&gt; records = consumer.poll(100);
 *         for (ConsumerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record : records) {
 *             buffer.add(record);
 *             if (buffer.size() &gt;= commitInterval) {
 *                 insertIntoDb(buffer);
 *                 consumer.commit(CommitType.SYNC);
 *                 buffer.clear();
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Subscribing To Specific Partitions</h4>
 * 
 * In the previous examples we subscribed to the topics we were interested in and let Kafka give our particular process
 * a fair share of the partitions for those topics. This provides a simple load balancing mechanism so multiple
 * instances of our program can divided up the work of processing records.
 * <p>
 * In this mode the consumer will just get the partitions it subscribes to and if the consumer instance fails no attempt
 * will be made to rebalance partitions to other instances.
 * <p>
 * There are several cases where this makes sense:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first case is if the process is maintaining some kind of local state associated with that partition (like a
 * local on-disk key-value store) and hence it should only get records for the partition it is maintaining on disk.
 * <li>Another case is if the process itself is highly available and will be restarted if it fails (perhaps using a
 * cluster management framework like YARN, Mesos, or AWS facilities, or as part of a stream processing framework). In
 * this case there is no need for Kafka to detect the failure and reassign the partition, rather the consuming process
 * will be restarted on another machine.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This mode is easy to specify, rather than subscribing to the topic, the consumer just subscribes to particular
 * partitions:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     String topic = &quot;foo&quot;;
 *     TopicPartition partition0 = new TopicPartition(topic, 0);
 *     TopicPartition partition1 = new TopicPartition(topic, 1);
 *     consumer.subscribe(partition0);
 *     consumer.subscribe(partition1);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The group that the consumer specifies is still used for committing offsets, but now the set of partitions will only
 * be changed if the consumer specifies new partitions, and no attempt at failure detection will be made.
 * <p>
 * It isn't possible to mix both subscription to specific partitions (with no load balancing) and to topics (with load
 * balancing) using the same consumer instance.
 * 
 * <h4>Managing Your Own Offsets</h4>
 * 
 * The consumer application need not use Kafka's built-in offset storage, it can store offsets in a store of it's own
 * choosing. The primary use case for this is allowing the application to store both the offset and the results of the
 * consumption in the same system in a way that both the results and offsets are stored atomically. This is not always
 * possible, but when it is it will make the consumption fully atomic and give "exactly once" semantics that are
 * stronger than the default "at-least once" semantics you get with Kafka's offset commit functionality.
 * <p>
 * Here are a couple of examples of this type of usage:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the results of the consumption are being stored in a relational database, storing the offset in the database
 * as well can allow committing both the results and offset in a single transaction. Thus either the transaction will
 * succeed and the offset will be updated based on what was consumed or the result will not be stored and the offset
 * won't be updated.
 * <li>If the results are being stored in a local store it may be possible to store the offset there as well. For
 * example a search index could be built by subscribing to a particular partition and storing both the offset and the
 * indexed data together. If this is done in a way that is atomic, it is often possible to have it be the case that even
 * if a crash occurs that causes unsync'd data to be lost, whatever is left has the corresponding offset stored as well.
 * This means that in this case the indexing process that comes back having lost recent updates just resumes indexing
 * from what it has ensuring that no updates are lost.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Each record comes with it's own offset, so to manage your own offset you just need to do the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Configure <code>enable.auto.commit=false</code>
 * <li>Use the offset provided with each {@link ConsumerRecord} to save your position.
 * <li>On restart restore the position of the consumer using {@link #seek(TopicPartition, long)}.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * This type of usage is simplest when the partition assignment is also done manually (this would be likely in the
 * search index use case described above). If the partition assignment is done automatically special care will also be
 * needed to handle the case where partition assignments change. This can be handled using a special callback specified
 * using <code>rebalance.callback.class</code>, which specifies an implementation of the interface
 * {@link ConsumerRebalanceCallback}. When partitions are taken from a consumer the consumer will want to commit its
 * offset for those partitions by implementing
 * {@link ConsumerRebalanceCallback#onPartitionsRevoked(Consumer, Collection)}. When partitions are assigned to a
 * consumer, the consumer will want to look up the offset for those new partitions an correctly initialize the consumer
 * to that position by implementing {@link ConsumerRebalanceCallback#onPartitionsAssigned(Consumer, Collection)}.
 * <p>
 * Another common use for {@link ConsumerRebalanceCallback} is to flush any caches the application maintains for
 * partitions that are moved elsewhere.
 * 
 * <h4>Controlling The Consumer's Position</h4>
 * 
 * In most use cases the consumer will simply consume records from beginning to end, periodically committing it's
 * position (either automatically or manually). However Kafka allows the consumer to manually control it's position,
 * moving forward or backwards in a partition at will. This means a consumer can re-consume older records, or skip to
 * the most recent records without actually consuming the intermediate records.
 * <p>
 * There are several instances where manually controlling the consumer's position can be useful.
 * <p>
 * One case is for time-sensitive record processing it may make sense for a consumer that falls far enough behind to not
 * attempt to catch up processing all records, but rather just skip to the most recent records.
 * <p>
 * Another use case is for a system that maintains local state as described in the previous section. In such a system
 * the consumer will want to initialize it's position on start-up to whatever is contained in the local store. Likewise
 * if the local state is destroyed (say because the disk is lost) the state may be recreated on a new machine by
 * reconsuming all the data and recreating the state (assuming that Kafka is retaining sufficient history).
 * 
 * Kafka allows specifying the position using {@link #seek(TopicPartition, long)} to specify the new position. Special
 * methods for seeking to the earliest and latest offset the server maintains are also available (
 * {@link #seekToBeginning(TopicPartition...)} and {@link #seekToEnd(TopicPartition...)} respectively).
 * 
 *
 * <h3><a name="multithreaded">Multi-threaded Processing</a></h3>
 * 
 * The Kafka consumer is NOT thread-safe. All network I/O happens in the thread of the application
 * making the call. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that multi-threaded access
 * is properly synchronized. Un-synchronized access will result in {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The only exception to this rule is {@link #wakeup()}, which can safely be used from an external thread to
 * interrupt an active operation. In this case, a {@link ConsumerWakeupException} will be thrown from the thread
 * blocking on the operation. This can be used to shutdown the consumer from another thread. The following
 * snippet shows the typical pattern:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class KafkaConsumerRunner implements Runnable {
 *     private final AtomicBoolean closed = new AtomicBoolean(false);
 *     private final KafkaConsumer consumer;
 *
 *     public void run() {
 *         try {
 *             consumer.subscribe("topic");
 *             while (!closed.get()) {
 *                 ConsumerRecords records = consumer.poll(10000);
 *                 // Handle new records
 *             }
 *         } catch (ConsumerWakeupException e) {
 *             // Ignore exception if closing
 *             if (!closed.get()) throw e;
 *         } finally {
 *             consumer.close();
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // Shutdown hook which can be called from a separate thread
 *     public void shutdown() {
 *         closed.set(true);
 *         consumer.wakeup();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then in a separate thread, the consumer can be shutdown by setting the closed flag and waking up the consumer.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     closed.set(true);
 *     consumer.wakeup();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * We have intentionally avoided implementing a particular threading model for processing. This leaves several
 * options for implementing multi-threaded processing of records.
 *
 * 
 * <h4>1. One Consumer Per Thread</h4>
 * 
 * A simple option is to give each thread it's own consumer instance. Here are the pros and cons of this approach:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: It is the easiest to implement
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: It is often the fastest as no inter-thread co-ordination is needed
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: It makes in-order processing on a per-partition basis very easy to implement (each thread just
 * processes messages in the order it receives them).
 * <li><b>CON</b>: More consumers means more TCP connections to the cluster (one per thread). In general Kafka handles
 * connections very efficiently so this is generally a small cost.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: Multiple consumers means more requests being sent to the server and slightly less batching of data
 * which can cause some drop in I/O throughput.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: The number of total threads across all processes will be limited by the total number of partitions.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h4>2. Decouple Consumption and Processing</h4>
 * 
 * Another alternative is to have one or more consumer threads that do all data consumption and hands off
 * {@link ConsumerRecords} instances to a blocking queue consumed by a pool of processor threads that actually handle
 * the record processing.
 * 
 * This option likewise has pros and cons:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>PRO</b>: This option allows independently scaling the number of consumers and processors. This makes it
 * possible to have a single consumer that feeds many processor threads, avoiding any limitation on partitions.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: Guaranteeing order across the processors requires particular care as the threads will execute
 * independently an earlier chunk of data may actually be processed after a later chunk of data just due to the luck of
 * thread execution timing. For processing that has no ordering requirements this is not a problem.
 * <li><b>CON</b>: Manually committing the position becomes harder as it requires that all threads co-ordinate to ensure
 * that processing is complete for that partition.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * There are many possible variations on this approach. For example each processor thread can have it's own queue, and
 * the consumer threads can hash into these queues using the TopicPartition to ensure in-order consumption and simplify
 * commit.
