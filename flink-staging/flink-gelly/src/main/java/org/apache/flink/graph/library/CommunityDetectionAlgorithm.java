/**
 * Community Detection Algorithm.
 *
 * Initially, each vertex is assigned a tuple formed of its own id along with a score equal to 1.0, as value.
 * The vertices propagate their labels and max scores in iterations, each time adopting the label with the
 * highest score from the list of received messages. The chosen label is afterwards re-scored using the fraction
 * delta/the superstep number. Delta is passed as a parameter and has 0.5 as a default value.
 *
 * The algorithm converges when vertices no longer update their value or when the maximum number of iterations
 * is reached.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2633.pdf">article explaining the algorithm in detail</a>
