/** Base trait for an algorithm which transforms the input data to some output data.
  *
  * A [[Transformer]] is used to transform input data to some output data. Transformations might
  * be feature extractors, feature mappings, whitening or centralization just to name a few.
  *
  * [[Transformer]] can be chained with other [[Transformer]] creating a [[ChainedTransformer]],
  * which again can be chained. Chaining a [[Transformer]] with a [[Learner]] creates a
  * [[ChainedLearner]] which terminates a pipeline.
  *
  * A [[Transformer]] implementation has to implement the method `transform`, which defines how
  * the input data is transformed into the output data.
  *
  * @tparam IN Type of incoming elements
  * @tparam OUT Type of outgoing elements
