# Apache Flink job cluster deployment on Kubernetes

## Build container image using Docker

In order to deploy a job cluster on Kubernetes, you first need to build a Docker image containing Flink and the user code jar.
Please follow the instructions you can find [here](../docker/README.md) to build a job container image.

## Deploy Flink job cluster

This directory contains a predefined K8s service and two template files for the job cluster entry point and the task managers.

The K8s service is used to let the cluster pods find each other. 
If you start the Flink cluster in HA mode, then this is not necessary, because the HA implementation is used to detect leaders.

In order to use the template files, please replace the `${VARIABLES}` in the file with concrete values.
The files contain the following variables:

- `${FLINK_IMAGE_NAME}`: Name of the image to use for the container
- `${FLINK_JOB}`: Name of the Flink job to start (the user code jar must be included in the container image)
- `${FLINK_JOB_PARALLELISM}`: Degree of parallelism with which to start the Flink job and the number of required task managers

One way to substitute the variables is to use `envsubst`.
See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23622446/4815083) for a guide to install it on Mac OS X.

In non HA mode, you should first start the job cluster service:

`kubectl create -f job-cluster-service.yaml`

In order to deploy the job cluster entrypoint run:

`FLINK_IMAGE_NAME=<job-image> FLINK_JOB=<job-name> FLINK_JOB_PARALLELISM=<parallelism> envsubst < job-cluster-job.yaml.template | kubectl create -f -`

Now you should see the `flink-job-cluster` job being started by calling `kubectl get job`.

At last, you should start the task manager deployment:

`FLINK_IMAGE_NAME=<job-image> FLINK_JOB_PARALLELISM=<parallelism> envsubst < task-manager-deployment.yaml.template | kubectl create -f -`

## Interact with Flink job cluster

After starting the job cluster service, the web UI will be available under `<NodeIP>:30081`.
You can then use the Flink client to send Flink commands to the cluster:

`bin/flink list -m <NodeIP:30081>`

## Terminate Flink job cluster

The job cluster entry point pod is part of the Kubernetes job and terminates once the Flink job reaches a globally terminal state.
Alternatively, you can also stop the job manually.

`kubectl delete job flink-job-cluster`

The task manager pods are part of the task manager deployment and need to be deleted manually by calling

`kubectl delete deployment flink-task-manager`

Last but not least you should also stop the job cluster service

`kubectl delete service flink-job-cluster`
