# Apache Flink Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is work in progress towards the new Flink runtime monitor. In particular, it will
provide the following missing features of the current web dashboard:

 - Live progress monitoring (via live accumulators)
 - A graph view of the program, as it is executed.
 - A REST style API to access the status of individual jobs.
 - A more modular design

The web dashboard can be activated by adding/uncommenting the config parameter
`jobmanager.new-web-frontend: true` in the `conf/fink-conf.yaml` file.
The dashboard listens at `http://localhost:8081`.

The new web dashboard is work in progress. It starts an additional HTTP server (by default at port 8081)
that serves the new web pages and additional background requests. It also relies on the old HTTP server
for some requests still.

**NOTE: Many values are placeholders still.**



## Server Backend

The server side of the dashboard is implemented using [Netty](http://netty.io) with
[Netty Router](https://github.com/sinetja/netty-router) for REST paths.
The framework has very lightweight dependencies.

The code is regular Java code built via Maven. To add additional request handlers, follow the
example of the `org.apache.flink.runtime.webmonitor.handlers.JobSummaryHandler`.


## Dashboard Frontend 

The web dashboard is implemented using *angular.js*. The dashboard build infrastructure uses *node.js*.
The dashboard files are all pre-built, so one can try it out without building it.


### Preparing the Build Environment

Depending on your version of Linux or MacOS, you may need to manually install *node.js* and *bower*.


#### Ubuntu Linux

Install *node.js* by following [these instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager).

Verify that the installed version is at least *2.11.3*, via `npm -version`.


Install *bower* via
```
sudo npm install -g bower
```
Verify that the installed version is at least *1.4.1*, via `bower -version`.


Install *gulp* via
```
sudo npm install -g gulp
```
Verify that the installed version is at least *3.9.0*, via `gulp -version`.


### Building

The build process downloads all requires libraries via the *node.js* package management tool (*npm*)
and the *bower* dependency management tool. The final build tool is *gulp*.

```
cd flink-runtime-web/web-dashboard
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

The dashboard code is under `/app`. The result of the build process is under `/web` in the src/main/resources folder.

When building Flink with Maven (in particular the `flink-dist` project), the generated
files are copied into the build target, to the folder `resources/web-runtime-monitor`.


### Developing

When developing the dashboard, every change needs to recompile the files and update the server:

```
cd flink-runtime-web/web-dashboard
gulp
cd ../../flink-dist
mvn -DskipTests clean package
```

To simplify continuous development, one can use a *standalone proxy server*, together with automatic
re-compilation:

1. Edit the file `app/scripts/index.coffee`. Comment/uncomment the lines that define the `webServer`, and `jobServer` URLs.
2. Re-compile the files via `gulp`. By calling `gulp watch`, the build-tool autocompiles future changes.
3. Start the proxy server via `node server.js`
4. Access the dashboard at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
